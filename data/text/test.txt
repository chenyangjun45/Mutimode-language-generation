who is understood to be in his 20s - is seen being dragged to the top of the building by three black-masked militants while two armed but undisguised fighters stand at their side using mobile phones to film the gruesome murder . the next image shows the man plunging to his death , falling face first from behind a white metal railing towards the ground several stories below . savages : isis militants are seen filming the man with mobile phones shortly before he is thrown to his death . propaganda : the photographs carry the distinctive yellow logo of isis ' propaganda wing al hayat media centre , suggesting they come from an as-yet unreleased video of the savage murder . spectators : the baying crowd are seen clambering on to rooftops to get a better view of the savage scene . bloodthirsty : the photographs shows a huge crowd gathering at the foot of a run-down building in the west of the city , which isis captured in early 2014 amid the ongoing chaos of the syrian civil war . the horrific murder is just the latest example of isis throwing men accused of being gay to their death . in december isis released their first images of the shocking punishment as part of a release that also showed men accused of rape being crucified and left for dead in the centre of raqqa . similar images emerged in january and early february of men being thrown from ` the highest point in the city ' following accusations of homosexuality . in a horrific twist , both of these men somehow survived the fall but were then stoned to death by the crowds gathered below . and just last week another young man was thrown off a roof and stoned to death after being accused of homosexuality . following a trial in an islamic state court , the man was taken to the roof of the building and thrown to his death in front a large crowd below . the man was described as a ` child of lot ' and accused of committing acts of sodomy . lot is referred to in the bible and the qur ` an , where it is claimed the people of sodom and gomorrah carried out sinful acts and were severely punished by god . the islamic state cherry picks sections of the koran and misinterprets the accounts of the prophet muhammad in order to wage jihad and sign up new recruits , experts say . it is estimated that 20,000 people have streamed into the territory in iraq and syria , where isis has proclaimed what it calls a ` caliphate ' , ruled by its often brutal version of islamic law . the group purport to recreate the conquests and rule of the prophet muhammad and his successors and maintains its worst brutalities - such as beheading captives - only prove its purity in following what it contends is the prophet 's example . but now muslims clerics and other experts are speaking out , saying that the group hand picks what it wants from islam 's holy book , the koran , and from accounts of muhammad 's actions and sayings , known as the hadith . an isis member parades through the streets of raqqa in syria waving an islamic state flag and brandishing a gun . experts have now said that isis misinterprets the koran in order to wage jihad . it then misinterprets many of these , while ignoring everything in the texts that contradicts those hand-picked selections . writings by the group 's clerics and its english-language online magazine , dabiq , are full of citations from koranic verses , the hadith and centuries of interpreters , mostly from hardliners . but joas wagemakers , an assistant professor of islamic studies at radboud university in the netherlands , says these are taken far out of context by isis . he explained that muslim scholars throughout history have used texts in a ` decontextualised way ' to suit their purposes and says that isis represent the extreme . he added : ` it would be a mistake to conclude the islamic state group 's extremism is the true islam that emerges from the koran and hadith .

' i was in shock at first but then i had a huge grin from ear to ear for the rest of the day . ' the news was particularly exciting for melba , who was just eight at the time the cat went missing , and was distraught over losing him . mrs collier explained : ` there were buckets of tears . melba was very distressed , even her dance teacher can still remember how upset she was - it was that traumatic . ' but rather than inform her daughter straight away , mrs collier waited until melba , who celebrated her 17th birthday yesterday , returned from bungay college that evening to break the news . mrs collier believes moonlight was living wild on a nearby heath , eating whatever he could catch . a female animal-lover also fed him scraps , and then took him to the vet when she noticed he had fur missing . melba said : ' i was just really shocked . eight years is a really long time and so i was not expecting it at all - it 's just so good to have our moonlight back after all this time . ' after a cautious reintroduction to echo , the family 's golden retriever , and two new pets , tilly the black labrador and dusty the cat , moonlight is happier than ever . mrs collier said : ' i was not sure he would remember us after so many years but he came straight home and he has been purring and rubbing himself up against us . ` he obviously still knows and remembers who we are - even the dog . ' ` we always knew he was a good hunter , so if he was alive he would probably be ok looking after himself . ` we think he must have been living wild on the heath near here , killing rabbits and mice , but also taking advantage of people who would feed him . ` we are just so happy to have moonlight back - it 's a genuine miracle . ' vet jenny reason , who discovered moonlight was microchipped , added : ` when a missing pet turns up , it 's usually a matter of days , sometimes a little longer , but i 've never known a pet to return after over eight and a half years . ` it 's a fantastic story - and just goes to show why it 's so absolutely vital to chip your pet .

' it also keeps you feeling fuller for longer . ` it comprises more protein than eggs and has a low gi , ' said professor schneck . ` this is particularly important because it allows the body to slowly digest the contents which may help with the feeling of satiety and allow for better absorption .

' a senior executive added : ` the bbc will do everything it can to keep him if it was just a bit of a dust-up , but if he is found to have punched him , then i think it 's gone too far . ' insiders suggested clarkson and mr tymon had given ` quite different ' versions of events . sources close to mr tymon say he was punched and left with a split lip , while clarkson has admitted some ` handbags and pushing ' but is understood to have denied anything worse . clarkson , pictured with co ho-hosts james may and richard hammond at a top gear live show in prague , will not be performing at the four events in norway as they have been cancelled . the four roadshows scheduled for norway next weekend were scrapped , on the eve of an internal report into clarkson 's fate . clarkson was suspended by the bbc two weeks ago , following allegations of a ` fracas ' with producer oisin tymon -lrb- left -rrb- over hot food . the bbc is set to lose as much as # 67million a year if top gear presenter jeremy clarkson is sacked over claims he punched a producer . the corporation 's commercial arm rakes in an estimated # 50million a year from selling the rights to top gear overseas , with the show watched in 214 countries around the world . on top of that , bbc worldwide makes millions more from top gear magazine and live shows in the uk and abroad , as well as sales of dvds . the bbc could lose tens of millions of pounds in annual profit if they do give clarkson his marching orders , with the sale of the show overseas making # 50million . top gear magazine has a global circulation of 1.7 m , bringing in another estimated # 7.4 million - not including profit from advertising , as well as the costs of producing and shipping the magazine . the motoring programme is also set to make around # 7.35 million in sales of tickets to its 14 live shows in the uk this year . there is also said to be a growing realisation within the corporation that it was a mistake to take top gear -- worth # 50million a year to bbc coffers -- off the air while the investigation was under way . ` the programme could and should have carried on during clarkson 's suspension , ' said an insider . ` jeremy wants to stay with the programme and one possible way of him doing that would be if he could face up to his own shortcomings . ` he has a great deal of public support ... but he does need to rest and sort himself out . ' the stakes were raised further yesterday as the 54-year-old reportedly promised to sue the bbc if he was sacked from top gear . it comes amid suggestions that the corporation is filming a pilot for a new motoring show called the getaway car , which will see contestants travel abroad to take part in driving challenges . a source told the sunday mirror : ` if clarkson is fired it wo n't be the end of it . lawyers will be involved . ' writing in the sunday times , clarkson also laughed off a foul-mouthed rant at bbc bosses filmed at a charity auction last week , claiming he only used the language ` in jest ' to raise money for good causes . a petition to have clarkson re-instated on top gear has gathered around one million signatures and was delivered to the bbc in london on friday . a decision about his future is expected this week , after the corporation 's director-general has considered the findings of macquarrie 's investigation .

' a mother 's chest area is significantly warmer than other parts of her body - ready to welcome her new baby and prevent them from cooling down - which is a significant risk . ` your baby has been lovely and warm in your uterus - at around 37 degrees , whereas the labour room will be significantly cooler , and he is wet -- it 's like getting out of the swimming baths , you need to get dry and warm quickly . ' meanwhile caroline davey , chief executive of the premature baby charity , bliss , echoed the importance of skin-to-skin contact . she said it is ` an essential part of family-centred care and should be part of the care that all babies receive ' . ms davey added : ` evidence shows that it can help to regulate the baby 's heartbeat , lower their stress levels and can play an important role in improving the positive outcomes for premature babies . ' ` he stopped breathing and his heartbeat was nearly gone . after 20 minutes they stopped working on him . ' the doctor sat on the end of ms ogg 's hospital bed and asked the couple if they had a name picked out . he then informed them that there was nothing more they could do to save jamie . ' i saw him gasp but the doctor said it was no use . i took jamie off the doctor , asked everyone to leave . he was cold and i just wanted him to be warm , ' she said . ` we had tried for years to have kids and i felt so guilty . i just wanted to cuddle him . i unwrapped him and ordered my husband to take his shirt off and climb into the bed . ' i know it sounds stupid , but if he was still gasping there was still a sign of life so i was n't going to give up easily . ' i know it sounds stupid , but if he was still gasping there was still a sign of life so i was n't going to give up easily , ' mrs ogg said . ` we were trying to entice him to stay . we explained his name and that he had a twin that he had to look out for and how hard we tried to have him , ' mrs ogg said . ` he suddenly gasped ... then he opened his eyes . he was breathing and grabbing dave 's finger , ' mrs ogg said . ` we were trying to entice him to stay . we explained his name and that he had a twin that he had to look out for and how hard we tried to have him . ` he suddenly gasped ... then he opened his eyes . he was breathing and grabbing dave 's finger . ` if we had let the doctor walk out of the room with him , jamie would have been dead . ' jamie and emily are now about to turn five years old and their parents have only recently told them of the miraculous story . 'em ily burst into tears , she was really upset and she kept hugging jamie , ' ms ogg said . ` they love to talk about when they were babies . ` they have a little brother charlie who loves telling anyone who listens . he 'll say : `` when i was born i was fat and the twins were skinny . jamie was also dead but now he is alive '' . ' emily and jamie also have a little brother charlie , 4 , and regularly talk about their miracle birth story . remarkably , jamie has not encountered one medical problem in the five years since his birth . when the twins were first told of their miracle birth , emily burst into tears and would n't stop hugging jamie . the ogg family have set up an online community called jamie 's gift to regularly raise funds for the miracle babies foundation - an organisation that supports premature and sick newborns . remarkably , jamie has not encountered one medical problem in the five years since his birth . ` he is absolutely fine ... the biggest concern they had was cerebral palsy because of the lack of oxygen but there 's been nothing , ' ms ogg said . ` it 's absolutely astounding . this whole experience makes you cherish them more . ' the ogg family have set up an online community called jamie 's gift to regularly raise funds for the miracle babies foundation - an organisation that supports premature and sick newborns . dave is currently training for an ironman triathlon in port macquarie in may to raise funds . ` he will put his body through a gruelling 3.8 km swim , 180km bike and a marathon , ' ms ogg said . for details on how to donate , visit jamie 's gift on facebook . dave is currently training for an ironman triathlon in port macquarie in may to raise funds . kate says the couple cherish everyday with their three children and are very ` touchy-feely ' parents considering everything they 've been through .

unprecedented access to breathtaking and awe-inspiring sights of our planet . and now the current crew , on expedition 42 , has created a collection bringing together some of the most stunning images of earth 's landscapes . from the glittering lights over the english channel to the sand dunes in oman and the concrete nature of new york , the world 's varied landmarks have been recorded from on board the orbiting craft . scroll down for video . the rub ' al khali , also known as the 'em pty quarter ' , is the second largest sand desert in the world . it has distinctive dune formations and covers 250,000 square miles -lrb- 650,000 square kilometres -rrb- including regions of saudi arabia , oman , the united arab emirates , and yemen . the current expedition 42 crew on iss has created a collection of images taken from the station of landscapes on earth . one of the most striking photos shows the glittering lights of the south coast of england and the north coast of france , taken above the english channel in january -lrb- pictured -rrb- . it shows concentrations of light in major towns and in the distance a green light that looks like the northern lights glows . all of these images form part of the nasa : landscapes by samantha cristoforetti collection . ms cristoforetti is one of six astronauts on board the station as part of expedition 42 . her colleagues include commander barry wilmore , flight engineer terry virts and russian cosmonauts elena serova , alexander samoukutyaev and anton shkaplerov . the expedition began on 9 november last year , when expedition 41 undocked and they are due to return in may . one of the most striking images in the collection shows the glittering lights of the south coast of england and the north coast of france , taken above the english channel in january . it shows concentrations of light in major cities and towns and in the distance , on the curvature of the earth , a green light that looks like the northern lights

of the 4,028 square mile -lrb- 10,432 square kilometre -rrb- land mass . mauna loa is the world 's largest , and one of its most active , volcanoes . the expedition also captured the contrasting and dense landscape of new york city . the grey , concrete-coloured image is in stark contrast to the vibrant blues of the ocean . in particular , the midtown areas of manhattan are so populated and compacted that the buildings look almost black . larger , more open spaces of airports including john f kennedy can just be distinguished . the entire international space station was spun 180 degrees yesterday and lowered slightly in its orbit last month so that visiting spacecraft can bring more cargo to the station . the remarkable manoeuvre saw a european spacecraft ` slow ' the speed of the station . this changed the height of its orbit by about 1.6 miles -lrb- 2.5 km -rrb- , before the station was spun back again to its original position . a second image was taken above the big island of hawaii in the north pacific ocean . it was captured on 28 february and the peaks of volcanoes mauna loa and mauna kea can be seen towards the centre of the 4,028 square mile -lrb- 10,432 square kilometre -rrb- land mass . mauna loa is the world 's largest , and one of its most active , volcanoes . it does n't erupt as frequently kilauea , but when it does eruptions produce rivers of lava that have threatened the nearby town of hilo . it rises almost 5.5 miles -lrb- 9km -rrb- and almost 90 per cent of its surface is covered by lavas less than 4,000 years old . from the relatively remote island of hawaii , the expedition has also captured the contrasting and dense landscape of new york city . the grey , concrete-coloured image is in stark contrast to the vibrant blues of the ocean . further west , ms cristoferetti captured this image above yosemite national park in california . the snow-topped mountains in the region , including mount dana , mount lyell and mount warren

hyde park bomb suspect john downey . </s> <s> but the government have insisted the letters do not provide immunity . </s> <s> the police have now confirmed they are probing six ira suspects . </s><summ-content>six suspected ira terrorists thought to be behind a string of bomb attacks in britain are facing new police probes after the government withdraw controversial letters insisting they were no longer wanted . the fugitive paramilitary suspects had all received so-called ` comfort letters ' under a peace deal negotiated by tony blair . telling them they could return to the uk without fear of being charged . but the letters only came to light last year after the collapse of the terror trail of ira suspect john downey , who was accused of murdering four soldiers in the 1982 hyde park bombing in london . tony blair negotiated a deal with sinn fein in which on-the-run terror suspects not wanted by police received ` comfort letters ' the case against mr downey was thrown out after he produced a letter from the government telling him he was no longer wanted and was free to travel to the uk . in the fall-out from the trail 's collapse , government ministers launched an inquiry into the letters -- and insisted they were not ` get out of jail free cards ' for terrorists . following the government 's intervention detectives now believe these ` comfort letters ' do not protect suspects from prosecution , documents leaked to the telegraph reveal . the police service of northern ireland wrote to mps on the northern ireland affairs select committee last week , revealing the major new phase in its inquiries into the ` on the run ' cases . in the letter , will kerr , the assistant chief constable , said the psni did not believe there was any barrier to prosecuting ` on the run ' suspects who had been sent ` comfort letters ' -- because coalition government ministers have recently said the letters had no legal force . ` whilst prosecutorial challenges may still lie ahead , the obstacles to investigating , arresting and charging suspects appear to have been removed , ' mr kerr said . the psni will ` prioritise ' re-examining the cases of 36 ` on the runs ' whose status was changed from ` wanted ' to ` not wanted ' during the scheme run by mr blair 's government under which mr downey was mistakenly given a letter of assurance . it is understood that ` comfort letters ' were given to suspects in the harrods car bomb in 1983 , which killed six and injured 90 , and the remembrance day bombing in enniskillen in 1987 . tony blair said the peace process with sinn fein leader gerry adams -lrb- right -rrb- and martin mcguinness would have collapsed without the letters . other atrocities under investigation could include the regent 's park bombing , in which seven military bandsmen were killed , on the same day as the hyde park bombing in 1982 , and the 1984 brighton bomb , which targeted the grand hotel where margaret thatcher 's cabinet members were staying , killing five people and injuring 34 . it comes as mps prepare to publish a year-long inquiry into the ` comfort letters ' scheme . as part of the peace deal bringing an end to the conflict in northern ireland , ira terrorists serving prison terms were let out of prison early . but this left the problem of fugitive terror suspects who had never faced trial . in a controversial agreement was reached between mr blair and sinn fein , police checks would be carried out and those who were no longer wanted would be sent a letter informing them of that fact . ira terror suspect john downey was wrongly sent an immunity letter . mr blair has insisted that only those individuals who were genuinely not wanted by police , and were therefore not going to face trial , were supposed to have received otrs . he also insisted the scheme was ` not secret ' , even though leading northern ireland politicians , including lord trimble , who was first minister of northern ireland from 1998 to 2002 , and senior police chiefs in the province were unaware of it . for the past 12 months , mps on the northern ireland affairs select committee have been investigating the on the run scheme . in a report to be published on tuesday , the committee is expected to raise questions over whether the policy of sending ` comfort letters ' to ira suspects during mr blair 's final months in office was lawful . mr blair has insisted the northern ireland peace process would have collapsed without the controversial scheme giving immunity from prosecution to republican terror suspects -- the so-called ` on the runs ' . the scheme , set up by the labour government in 1999 , assured more than 200 paramilitary fighters that they were no longer being hunted by the police . some 95 recipients of the so-called ` comfort letters ' were linked to almost 300 murders . under hostile questioning from the commons northern ireland affairs committee , mr blair refused to

' labour 's ed balls claims wages are worth # 1,600 less in real terms than they were in 2010 . labour has long argued that wages outstripped by inflation have left workers feeling poorer . they argue that average weekly earnings have fallen in real terms from # 453 in 2010 to # 418 in april 2014 . the attack is based on the claim that austerity choked off the recovery in 2010 , leaving employers unable to give pay rises . each year that prices rose faster than wages , workers saw that they cash did not go as far each month as it used to . in the commons today , ed balls declared : ` for all the chancellor 's hubris , yesterday 's budget has changed nothing for working people in our country . ` the chancellor spent an hour telling people they have never had it so good but working people are still gbp1 ,600 a year worse off on average after five years of the tories . ' ` even on his own measure , people are worse off than they were in 2010 . ` this is the first parliament since the early 1920s when the average person in work will be worse-off at the end of a parliament than they were at the beginning . ` the fact is in answer to the famous reagan question - ` are you better off than you were five years ago ? ' the answer is a resounding no . ' they both are . sort of . much of the discrepancy can be explained by the fact that the tories and labour are using different figures and different time scales . george osborne used real household disposable income , which is the amount of money a family has after tax and benefit changes take effect . figures published by the office for budget responsibility show that rhdi is lower than in 2010 in every year until the end of 2015 , before rising annually towards 2019 . technically it means that incomes will not be above 2010 levels until the end of this year , not before the election . ed balls uses gross weekly earnings , which is the amount workers are paid before tax and benefit changes take effect . labour 's figures also only cover the period up to april 2014 , compared to mr osborne 's date at the end of 2015 . paul johnson , director of the institute for fiscal studies , said : ` average household incomes have just about regained their pre-recession levels . they are finally rising and probably will be higher in 2015 than they were in 2010 , and possibly higher than their 2009 peak . ` but that still represents by far the slowest recovery in incomes in modern history . having household incomes crawl back up above pre-recession levels six or seven years after the recession hit is no cause for celebration . ` as ever there is much truth in both numbers . real earnings have fallen , as mr miliband says . real incomes should be above their 2010 level as mr osborne says . ` we are for sure much worse off on average than we could reasonably have expected to be back in 2007 or indeed back in 2010 . ' whether or not voters feel they are better off - and crucially will get better off in the future - will be key to deciding who is in number 11 after the election . when voters go to the polls in 49 days , both sides will keep repeating their claims . neither of which will reflect the true state of family finances on may 7 . labour is still looking back a year , while the tories are looking ahead seven months , based on a forecast . in truth , most people do not really know if they are actually better off than they were five years ago , when inflation , tax and benefits are taken into account . being told you 're better off will alienate those who are struggling , but after years of austerity voters also want a bit of optimism . even if they do not yet feel like the good times are back , they will want to believe george osborne when he says : ` the sun is starting to shine . ' and for the first time in five years he has some figures to prove it .

<s> residents of gravesend find gruesome-looking discovery on riverbank . </s> <s> arrangement of rope and metal makes it look like skeleton lying in mud . </s> <s> it is the latest in endless stream of objects found in river over the years . </s><summ-content>the murky waters of london 's river thames have receded to reveal hundreds of grim discoveries over the years . and residents of gravesend , next to the mouth of the famous waterway , feared they had stumbled upon another gruesome find this morning when this apparent skeleton turned up on the muddy banks . with two bone-like sticks appearing to be bent at the knees lying below seeming ribs and a skull , morning walkers thought they had come across the watery grave of a long-lost soul . this gruesome-looking object was found apparently washed up on the banks of the thames this morning . but as they approached the object , which was lying beneath the town 's pier , witnesses realised the supposed skeleton was just an optical illusion . photographer rob powell , who was at the pier taking pictures of a ship for website onthethames.net , said : ' i had to double take at first as it 's not the kind of thing you usually see by the riverside . ` obviously , it looked like a skeleton , which was a bit grim , and it was only when i got closer that i realised it was metal and old rope . ' the objects became the talk of the town after mr powell posted a photo on twitter . gravesend town centre manager graham long tweeted : ` we 've not seen anything like that before - how bizarre and intruiging . ' and the town 's rnli spokesman alan carr said the find looked ` very sinister ' . the object , spotted beneath a pier , turned out to be rope and metal poles which look like a skeleton . as well as a reported 50 corpses a year , the thames has given up a series of mysterious objects over the river 's long history . in 1857 , the 4th century bc ` battersea shield ' was discovered during dredging for the chelsea bridge , and is now seen as one the uk 's most significant pieces of celtic ancient art . prehistoric animal remains have also been discovered on the riverbed and banks , including the tooth of a 28-metre-long megalodon shark thought to be 1.5 million years old , and a section from the skull of a 30,000-year-old woolly rhino . in 2013 , river-users thought they has spotted an alligator living in the river - but it turned out to be a lost prop from the film set of james bond film live and let die , which had been washed away from its owner 's garden . flotsam often washes up at gravesend , a town situated at the mouth of the famous river , in kent .

' alzheimer 's disease is the most common form of dementia and is responsible for killing brain cells and shrinking the brain 400 per cent faster than the normal rate of ageing . mr graham is now taking part in research studies at university college london 's institute of neurology to help scientists understand the earliest signs of alzheimer 's to boost the search for new treatments . he said : ` although i know what will happen to me in the coming years , i now have direction in life . ' i wanted to do something to fight back against the disease -- to do as much as i can while i can . it 's simple for me , you have to hit the enemy directly , so i 've taken on a challenge to help support research and i 'm taking part in studies .

' a cure may come too late for me , but it will help my kids . we 've got man to the moon , so we 'll get to the answers if we put enough into it . i hope what i 'm doing will help inspire people to support alzheimer 's research uk . ' he is sharing his story in the same week a yougov survey commissioned by alzheimer 's research uk . early onset alzheimer 's tends to cluster within families , sometimes with several generations affected , in which case it is called familial disease . in some of these cases , it is caused by mutations in one of three genes . people with any of these extremely rare mutations tend to develop alzheimer 's disease in their 30s or 40s . these genes , and the prevalence of their defective versions is as follows : . these mutations are extremely rare and account for fewer than one in 1,000 cases of alzheimer 's disease . it is likely that all of those who inherit faulty versions of any of these three genes will develop alzheimer 's disease at a comparatively early age . on average , half of the children of a person with one of these rare genetic mutations will inherit the disease . people who do not inherit the mutation can not pass it on . someone who has two or more close relatives -lrb- a parent , brother or sister -rrb- who developed alzheimer 's disease before the age of 60 , is advised to ask their gp about genetic testing and counselling for these rare mutations , who can also refer patients to a geneticist , if appropriate . source : alzheimer 's society . this revealed that , when asked what they think dementia is and who it affects , just 23 per cent of british adults specifically mentioned brain disease or degeneration , despite a previous survey from the charity showing more than one in three people know a close friend or family member with the condition . hilary evans , director at alzheimer 's research uk , said : ` chris embodies everything that goes against the dementia stereotype -- he 's young and fit and his zest for life in the face of adversity is truly inspiring . ` although chris ' form of alzheimer 's is rare , the tragic consequences it has had on his relatives will resonate with thousands of families across the uk who have experienced alzheimer 's . ` chris ' situation shows how profound the impact of alzheimer 's can be -- this is not forgetfulness in old age , the disease is a destructive process that takes the ultimate toll . ` our new survey data shows we have a long way to go in dementia education . we need to recognise the physical process of alzheimer 's -- in doing so we 'll see that there 's something real we can attack and overcome with research . ` until we do , our own misunderstanding or prejudice risks becoming the biggest barrier to research . prime minister david cameron said : ` alzheimer 's is one of the key health challenges of this generation . ` chris has my absolute backing as he undertakes this mammoth challenge in aid of alzheimer 's research uk and abf the soldiers ' charity . ` travelling unsupported on an expedition which will see him cycle 16,000 miles around the coastline of north america , chris is a great example of someone who , when faced with a difficult diagnosis , has shown extraordinary grit and determination to overcome his circumstances and ensure that future generations can benefit from potentially life-saving research . ` these are important causes , and i urge everyone to get involved and support chris as he sets off on this daunting , once-in-a-lifetime journey .

' a new line of research suggests that the loss of arctic sea ice associated with global warming may be causing the jet stream to slow down and become wavier , thus setting up the unusual pattern over north america . ` other researchers think there could be a link between siberian snowfall and mid-latitude weather extremes . ` still others think changes in the arctic have little to do with mid-latitude weather extremes ; instead they see periods with an anomalously sharp gradient in sea surface temperature in the far western pacific as the key factor . all participants looking at the question agree : more research is needed .

' ms griffiths revealed she and other local catholics had avoided being married in the church because of the sick crimes that historically took place inside it . scroll down for video . australian actress rachel griffiths is happy that her former melbourne church has burned down because of its past links to a paedophile priest . her mother stopped taking her to the church after her father left them because pickering would n't have a ` divorced woman in the church ' . ' i think that 's probably one thing that saved our family that so many of my friends ' brothers got involved with , ' she said . ronald pickering abused boys between 1960 and 1980 while working as a priest in melbourne . ` we stopped going because he stopped my mother at the door . ' at least five people killed themselves after being sexually abused by paedophile priest ronald pickering between 1960 and 1980 , according to research carried out in 2012 . the former priest was named by the catholic church in 2013 as being guilty of sexually abusing children . however , after emigrating to britain in the 1990s he was never brought to justice before he died . one victim , raymond d'brass , told a 2013 victorian government inquiry that pickering groomed him with cigarettes , money and alcohol . he was abused between the age of 9 and 13 while acting as a choir and altar boy at the church . in his statement at the parliamentary inquiry on march 4 , 2013 , mr d'brass said : ` over this four-year period i am aware that two other boys were also sexually abused by father ronald pickering . ` i was regularly fondled and petted by pickering , as were other boys . this occurred within the change rooms of the church and within the presbytery . i began smoking cigarettes and drinking alcohol with pickering from the age of nine and on many occasions passed out from consuming the alcohol , which left me vulnerable to such abuse . ' 80 firefighters attended the scene to battle the blaze at st james church in brighton , in melbourne 's south-east . ms griffiths revealed she and other local catholics had avoided being married in the church . photos taken by eyewitnesses show the roof collapsed and plumes of smoke billowing into the sky . he recalled : ` i now have several vivid memories of the sexual abuses , as well as some vague flashes due to the state of intoxication . in 1983 , i stopped going to the presbytery after pickering verbally abused me in front of the other boys for choosing not to attend the upcoming sunday service and instead going to the cricket with my father . ` he told me that i was not welcome back and that i would burn in hell . between 1983 and 1987 , the two other boys who i know were abused continued to visit the presbytery and receive money , alcohol and cigarettes from pickering , but i chose not to because i was terrified of him . i have no doubt that they were continuing to be abused by pickering . ` one night after one of the boys paid a visit to pickering , he attempted suicide . he was unsuccessful on this attempt , but he would go on to successfully commit suicide a short time later .

<s> we 'd all like younger , fresher looking skin but it 's not always easy . </s> <s> the japanese skincare revolution says steaming your face is the answer . </s> <s> frances childs tested out the bizarre routine for femail . </s><summ-content>reaching up to close my kitchen blind , i catch sight of my neighbour in her garden . she raises her hand to wave , then stops . rooted to the spot , horror etched on her face , she looks as though she 'll never get over the shock . but i 'm not surprised . my face is the stuff of nightmares . covered in a cotton mask and wrapped in clingfilm -lrb- right -rrb- , i look just like hannibal lecter . i 'm swaddled like this because , according to a new bestselling book , the japanese skincare revolution , steaming your face by covering it in clingfilm is the secret to beautifully smooth and rejuvenated skin . a new bestselling book , the japanese skincare revolution , says that steaming your face and covering it in clingfilm is the key to rejuvenated skin . japanese women are renowned for their beautiful skin but , until now , no book in english has revealed the secrets of their beauty routines . now , we can discover the joys of massage to tone the muscles of the face and natural remedies for wrinkles , sagging , oiliness , pimples and blackheads -- including a step-by-step guide to the clingfilm mask . the idea is that the heat created by your breath and body warmth will encourage pores to open , so that the moisture from any water , creams or serums applied to the face will soak into the deeper layers of the skin , boosting collagen . ` moisture content is the most important factor in a rejuvenated complexion , ' says the book 's author chizu saeki , a celebrity beauty guru in japan . ` if skin is hydrated , it will look younger , firmer and fresher . ' she promises that her mask , which consists of water , followed by hydrating lotion , then serum -- will give me an instant youth boost . if i follow it to the letter , i can wave goodbye to botox , as water is the secret weapon in the war on ageing . surprisingly enough , the idea does have medical backing . frances childs -lrb- pictured -rrb- gave the bizarre technique a try and wrapped her own face in clingfilm to see what the results were like . ` we use clingfilm in severe cases of psoriasis to encourage cream to work at a deeper dermal level , ' says dr sunil chopra , director of the london dermatology centre in wimpole street , london . dr chopra says healing cream is applied to the skin , then wrapped in clingfilm before being left overnight in a process called occlusion therapy . the heat from the body encourages pores to open and the cream to absorb , rather than just sitting on the skin 's surface . in the past year , my complexion has begun to look grey and tired . at 46 , the lines around my eyes and mouth are becoming pronounced . so if wrapping my face in clingfilm helps me retain some semblance of youth , i 'm willing to give it a try . frances -lrb- pictured -rrb- bought cosmetic facial mask sheets and first soaked them in water before applying nars hydrating fluid to the mask . having bought a cosmetic facial mask sheet -- a thin piece of cotton in the shape of a face with the eyes , nostrils and lips cut out -- -lrb- # 2 for 40 , amazon.co.uk -rrb- , i set to work . first , i soak the weird-looking facial mask in water and wring it out . then , i liberally apply nars hydrating fluid -lrb- # 27.05 , narscosmetics.co.uk -rrb- to the mask , creating a thin layer of product over its surface . ` hydrating fluid is a moisturising agent , ' says dr michael prager , a cosmetic medicine specialist from london . ` it contains humectant , a substance that attracts and retains water . it gathers water on and below the skin 's surface and retains it , plumping out fine lines and smoothing the complexion . ' the book also recommends that you do a quick lymphatic drainage massage to clear toxins and reduce puffiness . with the mask drenched , i pat it on to my face , where it sticks like a damp cloth . though it 's strange , it feels pleasantly cool and less slimy and greasy than i had imagined . now to wrap my face in clingfilm . this feels horrid and , despite having created breathing holes around my nose and mouth , i feel claustrophobic . yet within minutes , the clingfilm is doing its job . beneath the mask , my skin feels smooth and slippery and i 'm clouding up from the humidity . i can feel the heat created by my breath . it 's not as hot as a sauna , but it 's several degrees warmer inside the mask than out . after 20 minutes , i whip off the mask as instructed . already , my skin looks smoother and plumper . now it 's time to rub in moisturising cream . i opt for estee lauder hydrationist -lrb- # 36 , john lewis -rrb- , though saeki says any cream will do because it 's how it 's applied that matters . after taking off the mask , frances -lrb- pictured -rrb- tries to follow follow saeki 's instructions on the art of water massage by spritzing water along the ` muscles of facial expression ' she recommends a quick lymphatic drainage massage . massaging lymph glands behind the earlobes , around the collarbone and under the armpits helps stimulate lymphatic flow , thus clearing toxins , she says . this , in turn , will help reduce puffiness in the face and lead to a clearer complexion . after slathering on the cream , it 's time to steam my face again -- only this time , i use a wet towel heated in the microwave for 30 seconds . beneath my warm towel , it 's dark and restful . i can almost feel the moisturiser seeping into my pores and , i hope , filling out the lines across my face . but the calm does n't last long . once the towel comes off , i 'm busy trying to follow saeki 's instructions on the art of water massage . using a spray bottle , i attempt to follow her diagram , spritzing along the ` muscles of facial expression ' -- along the forehead in a zig-zag from right to left , clockwise around the eyes and mouth , three short upward strokes along the cheeks and , finally , clockwise around my whole face . by the time i 've finished , i 'm soaking wet , with water dribbling down my face and plopping forlornly off the end of my chin . frances -lrb- pictured -rrb- was pleasantly surprised by the results of the clingfilm facial and says she thought her complexion looked instantly softer . onto the final leg of this marathon , and it 's time to massage serum into my face . i use skin-ceuticals serum -lrb- # 40 , amazon.co.uk -rrb- , a strong , hydrating product with hyaluronic acid -- an agent that encourages skin to attract and retain water . then i massage it into my damp skin , concentrating on smoothing out the lines around my mouth and on my forehead , and pressing it into my face with upward strokes . and , finally , i 'm done . the facial took half-an-hour , but it felt much longer -- perhaps because i was struggling to read the instructions through the clingfilm . nevertheless , i 'm pleasantly surprised . my complexion looks instantly softer , its greyish tinge replaced by a rosy hue , and the lines around my mouth and on my forehead have diminished . ` you wo n't get lasting rejuvenating effects from this facial because it wo n't increase collagen , which is the key to younger skin . but your face will look plumped out and smoother for 24 hours , ' says dr prager . however , saeki insists her facial has a cumulative effect , so if you repeat it three times a week for three months , you can knock off a decade . the day after , i meet a friend for lunch . she demands to know if i 've had a collagen filler . ` you 've done something and do n't tell me it 's just a good night 's sleep , ' she says . with a result like that , i 'm willing to mummify myself every evening for the rest of the year .

' but he said basic-rate taxpayers will be # 597 a year better off by 2017-18 because of increases in the personal allowance -- the point at which income tax of 20 per cent kicks in . mr osborne says he wants to deliver a threshold of # 50,000 for higher-rate tax and # 12,500 for the basic rate . the coalition has already raised the personal allowance from about # 6,500 to # 10,000 and it is due to hit # 11,000 in 2017 . mr osborne said the planned increases in the 40p threshold in the coming years -- which could be reversed by an incoming labour government -- were a modest ` downpayment ' on tory plans to raise the threshold to # 50,000 by 2020 . david cameron vowed last year to end the scandal of so-called ` fiscal drag ' , which has seen millions of people dragged into higher rates of income tax by below-inflation increases to thresholds . the number of people paying 40p tax has risen from around three million to five million since 2010 and is due to keep rising . the ifs , the leading independent expert on tax and spending issues in britain , has estimated that one in four taxpayers could be hit over the coming decade . but it has warned that such a large increase in the threshold ` might be politically difficult for a government to go ahead with ' given the likely backlash among voters . the tories have so far refused to say exactly where the money will come from to fund an increase in the 40p threshold to # 50,000 by 2020 . the policy has been opposed by labour and the lib dems . critics called on all political parties to raise the threshold at which the 40p tax rate kicks in . one leading tax adviser said the 40p rate of income tax ` was not intended to be a tax on people who you would hardly say are earning a fortune ' .

' before the accident : chen poses with a pony before a car accident left him with very little memory . hard worker : despite having very little memory , chen collects firewood for his family to use in the stove . the pair are totally dependent on each other , with chen having his mother there to reassure him about who he is and he , in turn , provides the physical strength to earn the money and carry out the household chores . a severe hit to the head can injure the brain and cause both short and long-term memory loss . memory is easily damaged by brain injury because there are several structures in the brain are involved in processing information , storing it and retrieving it . damage to those parts of the brain can result in memory loss . head injuries can trigger memory loss of the period immediately after the accident . a person can appear to be relatively well , but everyday memory for events or conversations can be interrupted . they can also forget the time from before the brain injury -- called retrograde and anteretrograde amnesia -- and the gap in memory will range from a few minutes to a few months . but the most common -- and the most troublesome - type of memory loss is short term memory loss . this can manifest itself in a variety of ways . examples of this are forgetting what has just been said , having difficulty in learning a new skill , repeating the same question over and over , forgetting people 's names , getting details mixed up , forgetting a change in routine and forgetting where things have been placed . there is no guaranteed cure for this type of memory problem , and rehabilitation will try to help a person cope using tried and tested strategies . however , memory is not like a muscle that can be developed just by stretching it . source : headway : the brain injury association . after the death of his father , he was forced to step up his bottle collecting activities , where he was spotted by a traveller who was fascinated by his story , and posted on social media where it quickly spread . beipu village chief , liu chin-ting , said the family receives monthly support from hsinchu county 's social welfare department , which is helping the family to get by . welfare workers also make it a point to visit chen and his mother during festive holidays , he said . but liu said he believes the boy could still have a future if there was a medical facility that was prepared to take in and give him proper physiotherapy and training . he said : ` he needs to get some preparation because his mother wo n't be there forever , and maybe they can get to the point where he can even hold down a regular job ' . the family have been flooded with offers of people wanting to send money but chief liu , who is helping to negotiate , said what they really need now is is practical everyday donations like tissue paper , rice , salt and soy sauce . he said : ` once the basics are sorted out , perhaps it might be possible to look at taking the time to find something more for the mid-term and long-term , but at the moment they just need to survive . ' chen meanwhile is clearly happy , as his diary notes that kind donations of money have been flooding in and he 's very happy that people want to help . he knows he is destined to forget everything , but also knows that nothing he can do about that except keep his sense of humour . he said : ' i am reading here about all the people that want to give me money , but i would say do n't give me too much , because it looks as if i 'll probably forget where i put it all . ' in the film before i go to sleep , 40-year-old christine lucas , played by nicole kidman lives a life where she wakes up every day forgetting what has gone on the day before . in a remarkable similarity , she has to remind herself by writing notes each day about what has happened to her since the car accident . alike : chen 's story has led to comparisons between himself and holywood blockbuster before i go to sleep -lrb- 2014 -rrb- , starring nicole kidman as christine lucas and colin firth as ben lucas .

' hot stuff : being a fireman -lrb- stock image shown -rrb- was one profession rated as being attractive by women in the study . however , displays of heroism in other fields , such as in sports or in business , also had no effect on how likely women were to find them attractive . the experiments follow on from a historical analysis undertaken by the research team , which looked at numbers of children fathered by us medal of honor recipients in the second world war compared to the numbers of children fathered by regular veterans . the analysis shows medal of honor recipients had an average of 3.18 children , while regular veterans averaged 2.72 children , suggesting decorated war heroes sired more offspring than other veterans . ` raids , battles , and ambushes in ancestral environments , and wars in modern environments , may provide an arena for men to signal their physical and psychological strengths , ' said dr leunissen . ` of course , women may not always witness these heroic acts in person , but such information is likely to be widely communicated within a tribal community , particularly when the actions of male warriors are outstandingly brave .

<s> almost 3.2 billion items of ` unaddressed ' junk mail were delivered last year . </s> <s> figures do not even include addressed leaflets that were also posted . </s> <s> rise has proved lucrative for royal mail with revenue soaring to # 1.1 bn . </s> <s> but critics said the company risked being labelled ` leaflet distributor ' </s><summ-content>more than 8.7 million flyers were delivered by the company in the year following its privatisation . royal mail has stepped up the amount of junk mail it stuffs through our doors since it was sold off by the government , new figures show . more than 8.7 million flyers were delivered by the company in the year following its privatisation -- sparking fears that it risks becoming a ` leaflet distributor ' . in the 12 months after privatisation , postmen pushed almost 50,000 more leaflets and advertising letters through our doors every single day , compared to the previous year . it means almost 3.2 bn items of ` unaddressed ' junk mail were delivered in just one year -- almost double the 1.7 bn delivered annually five years ago . these figures do not even include the vast quantities of ` addressed ' junk mail also delivered , which have the names of occupants on the envelope . the rise in unsolicited mail has proved lucrative for royal mail , which is struggling from increased competition in the parcels market and a fall in the number of ordinary letters being posted . revenue from ` marketing mail ' -- addressed and unaddressed -- has soared to # 1.1 bn a year , earning them # 3million a day . critics last night called for royal mail to reduce the amount of ` nuisance ' junk mail it delivers or risk becoming a ` leaflet distributor ' . royal mail admitted junk mail had become an ` important component ' of its business , and insisted many households found advertising flyers ` useful ' . but much of unwanted junk mail is never opened and ends up being thrown straight into the bin -- causing an environmental headache . while some households recycle takeaway menus and pamphlets , many tonnes of junk mail end up in landfill -- costing councils tens of millions of pounds to dispose of . a spokesman for the local government association said : ` junk mail is a blight on the nation 's doormats . ` not only is it a nuisance to pick up and throw away , it adds thousands of tonnes to the waste councils have to pick up creating additional costs for tax payers . ` royal mail and its direct marketing clients have to do far more to reduce the torrent of junk mail . ' robert rijkhoff , of the stop junk mail campaign , said marketing mail was ` the worst form of advertising ' because it was foisted upon households without their consent . he said : ` royal mail needs to make money but , if they deliver more and more junk mail as a source of income , in the long term i am not sure it is a sustainable business . ` royal mail is delivering less and less letters . they are risking that , in time , they will become a leaflet distributor . ' critics claim that some junk mail contain scams sent by fraudsters from overseas . critics said the company was running the risk of being labelled a ` leaflet distributor ' with fewer letters being posted every year . in 2011 , the national fraud authority claimed the royal mail logo was seen by some victims as a stamp of legitimacy , making the scammers appear more trustworthy . at the time , mike haley , director of the national fraud authority , royal mail and other delivery firms needed to ` understand the terrible consequences of delivery of this mail to some people ' . royal mail said the rise in marketing mail was due to the improved british economy , as companies found they had more money to advertise their goods and services . a spokesman said : ` marketing mail is mail like any other -- it is our job to deliver the mail . companies use direct mail because it has proven results . ` many households find the information useful . three in five people have acted in response to a piece of advertising mail in the last 12 months as a direct result of receiving door-to-door marketing material . ' as people increasingly stop posting letters in favour of email and text messages , royal mail said marketing mail was an important source of income . it said profit from this junk mail was important to ensure the survival of the universal service -- its obligation to deliver to every address in britain , six days a week , for the same price . they added that revenue from marketing mail helped to ` keep uk stamp prices among the best value in europe ' . despite this claim , first and second-class stamps will rise by a penny to 63p and 54p respectively on march 30 , sparking claims that loyal customers are being forced to prop up flagging revenue . the news sparked accusations from mps that royal mail had taken the ` easy option ' to raise stamp prices instead of fighting for new custom by improving its services . adrian bailey , chairman of the influential business select committee , said royal mail must invest in new technology and focus on efficiency , rather than simply increasing prices to boost profits .

' police were alerted and a store in leeds , where the parcel was delivered last year , was evacuated until experts examined the package . they quickly discovered it was a hoax and only contained hair dye and blue tissue paper , nottingham crown court was told . the 26-year-old , who worked in a boots warehouse at the time , admitted dispatching a parcel with the intention of inducing a belief that it was likely to explode or ignite and cause personal injury or damage to property . he was sentenced to 12 months in prison , suspended for 18 months , and ordered to carry out 150 hours of unpaid work . judge michael stokes qc , sentencing , said : ` sending you immediately to prison would perhaps misrepresent the seriousness of what you did . ` in the present day society anybody who produces a package and even pretends it is a bomb is creating a great deal of trouble and potential risk to innocent people . ` it had been a pathetic attempt by parkes but it still resulted in a store being evacuated and a great deal of public expense and inconvenience to a large number of people .

' prosecutors contend garrard made the girl run as punishment for telling a lie about candy , and refused to let savannah stop running even after the girl was vomiting and begging for an end to the exercise . in court , they cited a school bus surveillance video that captured garrard saying she would run the girl and teach her a lesson . reid told jurors that garrard had cried in the courtroom at the mention of her birthday , but did n't cry when jurors were shown the soiled blue pants savannah was wearing the night of her collapse . ` savannah is dead . joyce garrard is pitiless . she does n't believe she did anything wrong , ' he said . over some candy : garrard forced savannah to run around the house and carry wood as punishment for a lie about eating candy in february 2012 . while grandmother joyce hardin garrard was in the yard verbally prodding 9-year-old savannah hardin to run and pick up sticks , witnesses and attorneys said , stepmother jessica mae hardin watched idly from a distance , seemingly immersed in her laptop computer . and with savannah struggling to keep going and near the point of collapse , hardin went inside so she would n't have to keep watching the girl 's torment , a prosecutor suggested . later , it was hardin who called 911 and told authorities the girl had collapsed and was having a seizure , but only at garrard 's direction . savannah died within days in a hospital after being taken off life support . garrard -lrb- left -rrb- and jessica mae hardin -lrb- right -rrb- , savannah 's stepmother , were arrested in february 2012 . harden has also been charged with her murder , for allegedly sitting by as garrard ran the girl to death , which carries a life sentence . prosecutors portrayed garrard as a domineering grandmother who controlled savannah 's punishment despite the advice of a counselor , but they say hardin shares blame , too . authorities contend hardin , who was married to garrard 's son robert , should go to prison for failing to help her stepdaughter during the child 's ordeal on feb. 17 , 2012 . her refusal to come to the girl 's aid is tantamount to murder , the state has argued . hardin , 30 , has pleaded not guilty . she is free on $ 150,000 bond awaiting trial while prosecutors concentrate first on garrard , charged with the more serious offense of capital murder . no trial date is set for hardin , who was pregnant when savannah died and gave birth while in police custody following her arrest . defense attorney dani bone stood beside the jury box holding a small , dark rock and reminded jurors that in old times , the jury would participate in the execution by throwing rocks at the condemned . he said they have a right to say , ' i ai n't throwing that stone .

' because thursday was garrard 's birthday , deputies allowed her to hug relatives across the short wall that separates the front of the courtroom from the spectators before court opened in the morning . joyce embraced her husband johnny garrard for several minutes , rubbing his back and the back of his head as she and her relatives wept . afterward , she sat down at the defense table and stared at her son and savannah 's father , robert , who was in the courtroom for the first time . he sat directly behind the prosecution table and did not appear to return the eye contact .

' but a traveller movement spokesman told the newspaper : ` we are horrified by the bbc 's green-lighting of the use of the word `` pikey '' by the top gear presenters . embattled presenter : the future of clarkson -lrb- pictured leaving his house in london yesterday -rrb- at the bbc is in doubt amid claims that he punched a producer in north yorkshire . ruling : the bbc committee said it ` accepted that the word `` pikey '' did have the potential to be deeply offensive to the gipsy and traveller communities ' -lrb- file picture -rrb- . ` the claim that it has evolved a new meaning and that most people do not realise it has any reference at all with gipsies and travellers is absolute rubbish . ' the word ` pikey ' is believed to have been used as early as the 16th century . but it was not seen in print until 1837 , when the times used it to describe strangers who visited the isle of sheppey . the actual origins of the word are unclear . it could be connected to the word ` turnpike ' . these were toll roads , which had rotating barriers made of sharp poles called pikes - and vagrants were known to gather in these areas in the 18th century . an alternative version of the word is ` piker ' , which is said to have come from the verb ` to pike ' - which once meant to run away . now , the word is used as an insulting term towards gipsies - who have claimed in recent years that it is the equivalent of calling a black person a ` n ***** ' . it is also used in the modern day as a term to insult someone of supposedly low class . the bbc committee said it ` accepted that the word `` pikey '' did have the potential to be deeply offensive to the gipsy and traveller communities ' , but it cleared the programme of wrongdoing . clarkson 's future at the bbc is in doubt amid claims that he punched a producer in north yorkshire . he now faces an interrogation over his row with top gear producer oisin tymon by bbc chiefs , who are said to be ` desperate ' to get rid of him . ken macquarrie , head of bbc scotland , is leading an inquiry into the fracas and is expected to deliver a verdict within days . last night clarkson was at the centre of another controversy after he said in the march edition of top gear magazine that foreign taxi drivers in london have ` vehicles smelling of sick ' . he also turned on drivers in the north , saying northern roads are overrun with immigrants ` who have never experienced tarmac before ' . the inflammatory comments follow a string of racism rows . last year , clarkson apologised after he was filmed allegedly using the n-word in the poem ` eeny , meeny , miney , moe ' . shortly afterwards , he used the racist term ` slope ' in a show about burma . the racing driver who was the stig on top gear for eight years has said that the bbc show could thrive without the embattled jeremy clarkson . ben collins fell out with the broadcaster when it launched legal action - which it failed to win - over his decision to reveal his identity and publish his autobiography . he told radio times magazine that the presenter was not supportive of him in his own clash with the corporation . and he said that the bbc2 show could continue to succeed without him . claim : ben collins -lrb- left -rrb- , the racing driver who was the stig -lrb- right -rrb- on top gear for eight years , has said that the bbc show could thrive without the embattled jeremy clarkson . the stuntman stated : ` top gear has achieved huge status and jeremy has certainly been part of that because he 's got such a big personality ... he 's an unstoppable force . ` but fans of the programme love it for lots of different reasons . jeremy is certainly one of them , but not the only one , ' collins , who was the stig until 2011 , said . ` the bond franchise ... . changes and moves forward . top gear will always continue ... . it will carry on and continue to be successful because millions of people watch it . ' mr collins said that it had become harder for the show ` to reinvent itself ' , as it was ` possibly starting to strain under the weight of its own success ' . meanwhile , perry mccarthy , who was the stig from 2002 to 2003 , said that top gear without clarkson would take ` the fire out of it ' and ` wo n't work ' . ` i think you 're going to have a diluted product . i do n't think it will have the value that it did , here and overseas ' , he said . ` and god help any soul who takes his place , because that 's like signing up for your own firing squad . the only person who could take it on would be somebody who has nothing to lose .

' a yougov poll recently commissioned by the department for work and pensions shows that older women would prefer part-time work as they approach retirement . some 43 per cent of women who are not retired said the best way to retire would be to cut down to part-time or flexible hours before stopping work altogether . pensions minister steve webb said it was ` essential ' for the economy to get more women into work . pensions minister steve webb said : ` this analysis shows how supporting older workers to stay in jobs is an essential economic priority for the uk . ` the coalition government has taken bold action and is turning the tide , but there is more to do -- particularly to help older women combine work with caring responsibilities . ` business in britain needs to realise the potential of all older workers and take action on this . in the past we were too quick to write people off in this country once they reached a certain age , but the world has changed .

' then he suddenly broke down the mother-of-two 's front door at her home in preston , lancashire - and , armed with a knife , began grappling with adam wilson , 25 , who had been invited round for drinks , the court was told . miss emery - whose two young daughters were asleep upstairs - allegedly tried to stand between the pair in a bid to split them up , but mr wilson was left with a fatal thigh wound . the victim - who was barely known to meat factory worker taylor - was taken to hospital but bled to death before doctors could save him . preston crown court heard yesterday that the incident occurred on september 22 last year at 11pm - just two weeks after taylor had split with miss emery after an eight-month relationship . the couple had earlier been on a summer caravan holiday in scarborough , north yorkshire , but on their return taylor was said to have become upset when he discovered miss emery had terminated a pregnancy . two days before the killing taylor was at a local pub where he allegedly became so convinced miss emery was seeing someone else that he smashed a window and tried to punch a man who had once dated her . he was also constantly texting and phoning miss emery and would go to her house and sit outside watching what was going on inside - and sometimes even look through the windows , the court was told . louise blackwell qc , prosecuting , said on the day of the killing taylor texted miss emery to say : ` i miss you . maybe in time you 'll want to try again ' . trial : armed with a knife jason taylor -lrb- left -rrb- , 21 , began grappling with adam wilson -lrb- right -rrb- , 25 , the court heard . she asked him not to contact her , but later that evening he sent her another text saying : ` can i come for cuddles ?

' the artist believes the absence of descriptions wo n't matter to the archive 's visitors . he said : ' i respect viewers ' abilities to openly engage the images in the context of their own lives and their life experiences . ' some of the images are very moving and mr lazarus , who has two of his own in the collection , has to suppress his emotions on occasions . he said : ` because it is my job to work on projects like these i compartmentalize for the sake of the larger growth of the project . overall , the project continues to teach me and hopefully its audience , which significantly lessens any load . ' for him it 's the photographs of violence and empty landscapes that stand out . he said : ` i can easily project myself into those narratives . ' some photographs are just too harrowing for the senders to ever see again . as a result some images are displayed face down . so far , nothing has been sent in that 's too disturbing to display , but mr lazarus , an adjunct assistant professor at chicago 's school of the art institute , emphasizes that ` part of the project is to occasionally view harrowing images ' . he explained that hopefully the repository will be updated indefinitely . he said : ` i even have a fellow artist who will take over the project in case anything awful happens to me . i think it 's important the trust imparted to me is reciprocated to the participants . ' contributors to t.h.t.k come from all over the world , from a huge variety of cultures . mr lazarus said : ` i 'm hoping to reach anyone who feels the project gives them a sense of grace or greater meaning by participating . ' it certainly seems to be working , with the artist adding that reaction to the project has been ` strong ' . the photographs have been put on public display in several cities around the world , including the museum of contemporary art in chicago , future gallery in berlin , the contemporary jewish museum in san francisco and gallery tpw in toronto . some respondents had photographs that were so upsetting for them that they did n't want them displayed ever again - so these appear face-down in the archive . a photograph of a newly arrived submission for the project . some of the t.h.t.k images have been displayed in public including at the museum of contemporary art in chicago .

' on tuesday , heather mack gave birth to a baby girl via caesarean at sanglah hospital in denpasar . in exclusive pictures , obtained by daily mail online , mack was seen at the window of her hospital room a day after giving birth to her 6lb 1oz daughter , stella schaefer , the last name being that of the baby 's father and her co-accused . the accused murderers have claimed in court that the unborn baby had been at the center of problems . however , emails provided by mr jacobson to the chicago tribune , revealed that heather mack had a long history of violent outbursts , stealing and manipulative behavior . in march 2014 , mrs von wiese mack wrote in a string of emails to her longtime friend about her teenage daughter 's explosive rages . ` her anger escalates at an alarming rate and she seems to have no control over it - very scary . at least she did n't hit me - her rage went to the window instead , ' she wrote , according to the tribune . in another email she wrote : ` heather ran away again tonight . she will not answer her phone . she will not answer emails and she told me that she would kill me and then kill herself ... i feel so desperate . ' in one chilling message to her friend , mrs von wiese mack wrote : ' i am really scared of what she may do next . ' mr jacobson , 72 , who worked in politics , passed on the emails to the tribune so that his friend 's voice may be heard , he reportedly said . earlier this week mack had given birth in a caesarean operation to her 6lb 1oz daughter , stella schaefer , the surname being after the father and her co-accused 21-year-old tommy schaefer . heather mack and tommy schaefer , from chicago , illinois , -lrb- pictured in court on march 12 -rrb- are being tried separately by the denpasar district court . they could both face a firing squad if found guilty of her mother 's brutal murder last august . although miss mack was not considered a flight risk , she remains under guard at all time , no matter what the circumstances , at the sanglah hospital with her baby beside her in a cot . joining her in the hospital room were the child 's grandmother , tommy schaefer 's mother , and other relatives and friends who had flown from their homes in chicago . and it is from his mother and relatives that schaefer will have to rely for a first-hand description of his baby , for he has been refused the right to travel under guard from kerobokan prison to the hospital . prison sources said he was ` pacing up and down with frustration ' in his cell as he anxiously waits for the moment when he will first set eyes on his daughter . ` he 's going crazy in there , wanting to see his daughter , but he 's been told he 's a prisoner on a serious charge and there will be no hospital visits , ' a prison source said . unless the prison grants him a special privilege to see the baby , he is unlikely to see her until - and if - miss mack takes the child with her to their next scheduled court appearance on march 24 . there is every likelihood of the couple 's next court appearance - their cases are being held separately - being adjourned while she regains the strength to face the judges in the denpasar district court . miss mack earlier had expressed fears that she would have to deliver the baby behind bars because she did not have a down payment that the hospital wanted up front . but her u.s. attorney , anthony scifo , has told the chicago tribune that he was able to send money to indonesia earlier in the week after working out a deal with miss mack 's uncle , who controls $ 1.56 million in a trust fund set up for her by her murdered mother . miss mack does not have access to the money before her 30th birthday . miss mack planned to keep the baby with her in the cell for the maximum allowed period of two years - unless there are dramatic developments in the case against her and she is able to leave the notorious prison . sheila von wiese-mack 's badly beaten body was found in a suitcase in the trunk of a taxi at the hotel . it was not known when she will be returned to the prison with her baby , but hospital staff suggested it could be within the next 48 hours . mack had earlier told friends who have been supporting her during jail visits that she was expecting her baby in april . this means the child was born prematurely . last week , schaefer told the trial that he had been attacked by wiese-mack and called a racially offensive slur . he said that his relationship with heather was not endorsed by her mother and he went to bali to decide how to tell her they were pregnant . after meeting with mack at the hotel , they discussed how to inform mrs von wiese-mack that mack was pregnant and agreed to meet in the hotel room where mack and her mother were staying . speaking through an interpreter , schaefer said mack asked him to bring a metal fruit bowl , which he hid under his shirt as a ` precaution ' . asked by a judge why it was hidden , schaefer answered that he was not sure whether he would use it or not to protect himself . according to schaefer , he arrived in the room and found miss mack weeping . he did not know why , but also saw her mother was screaming . ` she -lrb- von wiese-mack -rrb- was angry at me when she knew that heather was pregnant , ' schaefer said , while trying to hold back tears . heavily pregnant mack -lrb- pictured right a week before the birth -rrb- and boyfriend tommy schaefer -lrb- second from left -rrb- , 21 , sit in the court room in front of what is believed to be the suitcase they are accused of using to hide the body of her mother , sheila von wiese-mack . miss mack , who was sitting beside her lawyer , sobbed at the testimony . he said that the victim insulted him using a racial slur and described her daughter as a prostitute who liked a black man . he said the situation got heated when mrs von wiese-mack asked her daughter for an abortion or to kill the unborn baby . schaefer said that led to a quarrel in which mr von wiese-mack strangled him hard for about 30 seconds . ' i was angry , i took the fruit bowl and hit her , ' schaefer said , in tears . he added that he did not remember how many times he hit the victim . after acknowledging she was n't breathing , he tried to give her artificial respiration , while mack , who had run in panic into the bathroom for about three minutes , came back and tried to revive her mother . he said he was trembling and scared and called 911 on his mobile phone before realizing that he was not in the united states . in her first questioning in court last wednesday , mack , who is eight months ' pregnant , said schaefer beat her mother with a metal soup bowl after von wiese-mack made the threat in an argument . ` the blow was not so hard ... and my mother was still resisting , ' miss mack said . ' i asked tommy to stop and then i ran into the bathroom . ' the 62-year-old 's bludgeoned body was folded in half and stuffed into a suitcase with bloody sheets . in january , mack had said she vowed to bring the baby up in the cramped bali prison she shares with six others . she has told fellow prisoners in the wijaya kusuma cell block of her intentions - but that has not gone down well with several of the other women . ` make arrangements to get your baby out of here , ' one prisoner was reported to have angrily told her . ` we 're fed up with being woken by crying babies .

' the state department did its best to handle the problem quietly , making no announcement during the regular daily reporters ' briefing on friday and issuing a subdued statement 21 minutes before the end of the work day . abc news reported that the cyber intrusion is one of the most serious in the agency 's history . but state framed it as a ` planned outage ' and a routine ` upgrade ' to its digital security systems , blocking its employees from sending outside emails and shuttering their web browsers for an unspecified stretch of time that could last for days . ` as a part of the department of state 's ongoing effort to ensure the integrity of our unclassified networks against cyber attacks , ' spokeswoman jen psaki said in a statement , ` the department is implementing improvements to the security of its main unclassified network during a short , planned outage of some internet-linked systems . ' ` the department continues to closely monitor and respond to activity of concern on our unclassified network . such activity is something we take very seriously . ' nothing to see here -- move along ... state department spokeswoman jen psaki downplayed the damage , saying that a ` planned outage ' was in the works . malware : hackers inserted malicious code into nonclassified computers at the state department , leaving tech experts no choice but to shut everything down and clean it up . ` there has been no compromise of any of the department 's classified systems , nor of our core financial , consular , and human resource systems , ' psaki claimed . ` the recent increase in news reports regarding cyber incidents reflects that the department is among a growing list of public institutions and private industries facing an increasing number of sophisticated cyber threats . ' this is n't the first such outage to hit america 's diplomatic nerve center : the same kind of event happened once in november when the state department carried out what it called an ` upgrade ' following an october cyber attack . two state department employees told daily mail online that they could n't reach websites from their office computers during the dinner hour on friday , and confirmed that no emails were going in or out other than interdepartmental messages . hackers have run roughshod over computer servers in the executive branch of the u.s. government in recent years , targeting the white house on a regular basis . in october , following an outage covering much of the executive office of the president , white house press secretary josh earnest told reporters it should ` not be particularly surprising ' that ` there are many people around the world who would love to gain greater insight into the activities of the united states government by collecting information from the white house network . ' many did find it surprising , however , to hear earnest acknowledge that the computer infrastructure of 1600 pennsylvania avenue is ` subject to daily cyberattacks , or at least efforts to infiltrate it . ' the fbi , the nsa and the secret service were all involved in an investigation , with insiders telling news organizations that -- as with friday 's state department trouble -- russian hackers were the most likely suspects . in august 2014 a cybersecurity firm discovered that russian hackers had stolen 1.2 billion user names and passwords in a series of internet heists affecting 420,000 websites . and a months-long sustained cyber attack on jp morgan chase last summer also originated in russia , security officials believe , and may have also targeted as many as nine other banks . could it be ? russia 's government is still angry at the obama administration for imposing tough eceonimc sanctions on the nation 's oligarchs following president vladimir putin 's annexation of crimea . at least 83 million bank accounts were affected , mostly belonging to consumers but includnig about 7 million commercial customers as well . hackers got access to customers ' names , addresses , phone numbers and email addresses . saparately , the fbi offered a $ 3 million reward last month for information leading to the capture of a russian hacker believed to be behind the electronic theft of $ 100 million from american bank accounts . evgeniy bogachev is accused of deploying a ` botnet ' -- a hijacked super-network of personal computers controlled remotely without the owners ' knowledge -- by spreading malicious software through spam emails . the fbi described bogachev 's technique last year as ` an extremely sophisticated type of malware designed specifically to steal banking and other credentials from the computers it infects .

' photographs from 1966 show the upper geyser basin pool 's original blue colour , before the build up of coins and rubbish . the pool received its name in 1883 from mrs mcgowan , who was the wife of assistant park superintendent , charles mcgowan . as a nod to its then crystal blue colour , she named it after the blue flower , morning glory . although it was originally known by its latin name , convolutus , by 1889 it was commonly known by its current name . over three million people enjoy the yellowstone national park annually , spans an area of 3,468.4 square miles , comprising lakes , canyons , rivers and mountain ranges . unless some subterranean shift happens where more hot water can again flow to the surface , morning glory will never be fully blue again . half of the world 's geothermal features are in yellowstone national park , fueled by yellowstone caldera , the largest supervolcano on the continent . the pool has warning signs around it , in an attempt to reduce further vandalism to its waters , -lrb- left -rrb- . it has been dubbed fading glory , now bearing little resemblance to the bright blue flowers which gave it its name , -lrb- right -rrb- .

' mr caan was previously mired in controversy after offering to buy a baby from pakistan for # 750 . a source close to him brushed that incident off as an 'em otional response ' to the flooding there . but the source close to mr caan insisted : ` as mr caan had an existing relationship with awards intelligence he felt it entirely appropriate to seek advice on the procedural process of the uk 's honour system after he was nominated . ` any suggestion that mr caan instructed awards intelligence or any other third party to nominate him or to in any way exert any pressure or bring influence to bear on the honours committee to obtain an unfair advantage is completely untrue . ' the source added that mr caan 's rejected offer to buy a baby had been ` an emotional response ' to the misery caused by floods in pakistan . when asked by the daily mail about his honour , mr caan refused to comment . the tycoon was also the subject of controversy two years ago when he was made a ` social mobility tsar ' by the government . he criticised nepotism and said parents should let their children stand on their own two feet -- but it later emerged that his daughters hanah and jemma had worked at his firms . one was also put on the board of trustees of his foundation .

' he tried contacting the police , but to no avail - they told him there is no law preventing people from taking his online pictures , since he had them on a public setting . eventually , one of the women hacked into ` david 's ' account and discovered his true identity - a 65-year-old married man from the uk living in spain . after jon tracked him down online , ` david ' apologised , describing himself as ` just a sad lonely man ' and claiming that he was mentally unwell . still , jon felt that justice needed to be served - not just for him , but for the dozens of girls and women ` david ' had duped . so he tried contacting the police , but to no avail . he was sent to action fraud , which deals with internet crime , but they told him there was not much they could do about it . their advice was to edit his privacy settings or take down his accounts altogether , but jon did n't want to give his impostor that satisfaction . he said : ` they told me to just make my profiles private - that 's not a response , that 's just sticking your head in the sand and pretending it wo n't happen to the next person . ` i 'm not going to miss out on meeting new people , getting new business or being myself by not embracing social media or the 21st century . ' despite the incident , jon has decided not to let it affect his online life . he said : ' i do n't think you can live your life in fear of people doing bad things ' instead , he believes it 's time law was updated in order to protect internet users from this kind of criminal behaviour . ` there was a clear and obvious pattern of grooming where he would take them from a public forum , to a private email , to speaking on skype or on the phone , ' he said . ` that 's the most creepy thing and worrying behaviour about this - and the police still were n't interested despite all the evidence . ' i was worried that if this was just the tip of the iceberg - who was this man ? what would he do if i told the police ? ` also , what would the family of these girls think of `` me '' despite the fact it was n't me doing all this - it was someone using my face . ' jon has spent the last few months attempting to get all 15 of ` david 's ' fake social media profiles taken down , an arduous process that has yet to be completed . when jon 's imposter was finally tracked down , he was revealed to be a pensioner in spain -lrb- picture posed by model -rrb- . one social media site told him that his impostor did n't break their ` community usage policy ' , while another never replied to his emails . despite the fact that some of the fake accounts are still up to this day , jon has decided not to let it affect his online life . he said : ` i 've met some of my closest friends online as well as an ex-boyfriend too .

' the illegal trade is being fuelled by the desires of china 's wealthy middle classes for carved ivory items . with ` white ' elephant ivory and rhino horn becoming more scarce , the eia found traffickers were dealing instead in ` red ' ivory from a hornbill casque . this now sells for as much as # 4,000 a kilo -- three times the price of elephant ivory . there are no reliable estimates of the impact of poaching on populations across the hornbills ' historic range of borneo , sumatra and the malaysian peninsula , but in one region alone , the kalimantan , an estimated 6,000 birds are killed every year . mr hadiprakarsa , director of the indonesian hornbill conservation society , said : ' a few years ago helmeted hornbills were common in the west kalimantan , but on my last visit i did n't see any and local villagers said they had n't either . ` hunters are now pushing into the remotest areas of the forest . ' the illegal trade in ivory from the birds is being fuelled by the desires of china 's wealthy middle classes for carved ivory items . chinese visitors look at souvenirs made from ivory at a market in angola . the ivory , which comes from helmeted hornbills , is three times the price of that of an elephant . poachers , who shoot then decapitate the birds , often return from expeditions with as many as 20 hornbill heads . these are then sold for up to # 300 each to middle men or direct to smugglers exporting to hong kong and china . eia campaigner debbie banks said : ` what is sickening is this trade has nothing to do with tradition or medicine -- it 's purely about demand for luxury vanity products .

<s> selfish , shallow , and self-absorbed : sixteen writers on the decision not to have kids was edited by los angeles-based author meghan daum . </s><summ-content>a group of writers are challenging the notion that becoming a parent is the key to a fulfilling and happy existence in a bold new anthology of essays , which explores each contributor 's conscious decision to forgo having children . selfish , shallow , and self-absorbed : sixteen writers on the decision not to have kids was edited by los angeles-based author meghan daum , 45 , who curated the essays of 16 writers , including lionel shriver , sigrid nunez , kate christensen , elliott holt , geoff dyer and tim kreider , for her new book , which is slated for release on tuesday . but the anthology does n't take jabs at those who 've decided to have children , rather it takes a look at how others have come to the decision that parenthood is not for them in a culture that worships parenthood . being honest : meghan daum edited 16 writers ' essays about their decision to forgo having children in her new book selfish , shallow , and self-absorbed : sixteen writers on the decision not to have kids . just the two of us : ms daum , who does n't have children , posed for this selfie with her husband . ` these essays have so many people talking about the ways that they do have relationships with kids , nieces or nephews or kids that they mentor , ' ms daum told flavorwire . she added : ` you 've heard the cliché `` it takes a village '' , but there are so many ways of being a responsible villager . ' the writers who contributed to the book candidly explained about how they came to the decision to live a child-free existence without judgement - which is a refreshing take on a unnecessarily controversial choice that is often met with confusion and criticism . for her book , ms daum sought out the perspective of both men and women , although a majority of the essays in the collection are from female writers . ' i think we could be wary of the assumption that parenthood is the only way to be an adult , ' ms daum told the outlet , noting that ` it 's less taboo to say , `` i 'm a shallow person '' than to say that this is n't for me . ' major debut : ms daum 's new collection of essays will be published on tuesday . while most conversations about parenting revolve around how women ` can have it all , ' this book suggests that maybe they do n't want to - or even need to . ms daum first thought about sharing the stories of childless adults from a variety of professions and walks of life , but she chose to curate her book with essays from writers because of their ability to ` interpret the world ' in a responsible way . most of the writers featured in the anthology are over the age of 30 , ms daum said she ` did not have an age cutoff ' , but noted that it would be difficult to have someone in her twenties make a public declaration that she would never have children . ms daum wrote about her own choice not to have children in an essay titled difference maker , which appeared the unspeakable : and other subjects of discussion , her collection of persona essays that was published last year . ` after more than a decade of being told that i 'd wake up one morning at age 30 or 33 - or , god forbid , 40 - to the ear-splitting peals of my biological clock , i would still look at a woman pushing a stroller and feel no envy at all , only relief that i was n't her , ' she recalled in difference maker . throughout the essay , ms daum recounted getting pregnant , miscarrying the baby and subsequently deciding that she did n't want to be a mother . in her new book , ms daum does n't touch upon her own life with children beyond the introduction .

' the final straw came on christmas day 2010 when wanda visited her father but was told she was only allowed one hour with him , supervised by staff . she said she called her three brothers , ivan , 55 , wayne , 54 , and eden , 49 , who lived near their father and visited him regularly , and between them they hatched a plan to free him . the following day , on boxing day 2010 , the three men went to the care home , got their father out of the fire door , took him for a meal and then called wanda . she then took him to her home in turkey , where he remained for 13 weeks . mr maddocks -lrb- above -rrb- , who apparently hated being in care homes , died in hospital on january 8 , 2013 . wanda said : ` two of my brothers got him out through the fire doors and they passed him to me and i took him to turkey . it was the great escape . ' however , the court of protection -- which was set up to safeguard vulnerable individuals -- got wind of the situation and , when wanda flew back to the uk with her father in february 2011 , the pair were prevented from returning to turkey . wanda said : ` we flew back to sort his pension , only to find his money had been frozen . then the whole court of protection thing started . ` we were basically told that if we did not adhere to whatever decisions the court made , we could be jailed and our assets seized . ' mr maddocks was made the subject of a deprivation of liberty safeguards order and taken into care again -- at abbots house care home in abbey hulton , stoke-on-trent - while wanda was forced to attend more than 20 court hearings and be subjected to several psychiatric evaluations . she was eventually jailed for six weeks in mid-2012 at foston hall women 's prison near derby , which once housed maxine carr , girlfriend of soham killer , ian huntley . she became the first person to be jailed by the so-called ` secret court ' , the court of protection , which settles the affairs of those deemed too ill to make their own decisions . her crime was contempt of court , for repeatedly breaking orders not to interfere with her father 's life at his care home . however , she believes her only crime was an act of compassion towards the father she loved and trying to keep a solemn promise to him to keep him out of care homes . following her release from prison , her father was moved to yet another care home in december 2012 before being taken into hospital for illness . he died weeks later on january 8 , 2013 . wanda told the inquest today : ` my dad always said to me `` do n't you ever put me in a care home '' and i never forgot those words . ` there was a fair amount of disagreement between myself , social services and the city council . ' i thought it was better for him to be in the sunshine in turkey rather than in a care home . ` they said he was too aggressive to be in the community and he had put his fist up . ' wanda -lrb- pictured -rrb- told an inquest into her father 's death in stoke-on-trent this week that ` there was a fair amount of disagreement between myself , social services and the city council ' . she was jailed for six weeks . wanda spent six weeks in foston hall women 's prison near derby -lrb- pictured -rrb- after the court of protection ruled she had committed contempt of court . she said her only crime was compassion towards her father . the jury was also told how wanda was happy for her father to be in a nursing home -- which provides additional care -- but was n't satisfied with him being in a care home . however , staff at the care home told the inquest that mr maddocks was being cared for in the right place at the time . care worker amanda cain said : ` we were able to meet mr maddocks 's needs . at times he was aggressive but that could be very short-lived .

' the chairman of the house homeland security committee , texas republican rep. michael mccaul , said the findings were ` extremely concerning ' and that he will conduct a congressional hearing about them thursday . roth was expected to testify . hillary clinton 's brothers hugh rodham -lrb- left -rrb- and tony rodham -lrb- right -rrb- have been intermittent sources of embarrassment since her days ad first lady during the 1990s . sls las vegas , a casino that opened late last year , benefited from undue influence in securing foreign investors with the promise of visas that could lead to us citizenship . the white house praised mayorkas on wednesday when asked about the brewing scandal , saying he still works at dhs ` because he is a decorated public servant and an effective leader of that organization . ' press secretary josh earnest said the president and his advisers ` certainly value the kind of contribution that he has made to the effective management of that department , and he has played an important role in implementing needed reforms in that department . ' in fact , earnest told fox news ' ed henry , mayorkas is ` leading the effort ' to implement reforms in the department in question and ` strengthen ' the eb-5 program . after henry expressed shock at white house 's full-throated support in the homeland security official who ` basically gave special visas and access to politically-connected democrats , ' earnest said , ` to be clear , ed , the inspector general , who , as you point out , did take a close and independent look at this , did not suggest that these individuals were n't deserving of a visa . ' ` what he suggested is merely that the process did n't work very well , ' obama 's spokesman said . ` these are exactly the problems that deputy secretary mayorkas was trying to address , and there are additional reforms that are needed , and there will be additional reforms that are implemented . ' refusing to let earnest off the hook , henry asked if mayorkas was trying to make reforms when he let hillary clinton 's brother ` jump to the front of the line . ' ` that 's not the accusation , ed , ' the white house spokesman fired back . ` go back to the inspector general report - that is not what it said , ' a visibly agitated earnest told him . the inspector general 's new conclusions also cast doubt on whether the homeland security department withheld embarrassing internal files the ap had sought under the u.s. freedom of information act as part of its own investigation nearly two years ago -- and instead released records that indicated no wrongdoing . the ap in july 2013 requested all emails to or from mayorkas over the preceding seven months that contained specific words or names , including rodham . the government eventually sent ap more than 200 pages , mostly censored , including emails in which mayorkas told investors and agency staff that he would not become involved in internal deliberations . ' i can not weigh in , ' mayorkas wrote to assistant secretary douglas smith on feb. 1 , 2013 , in a message turned over to the ap and cited in the new inspector general 's report . ` the -lrb- investor 's -rrb- attorney sent an email to me and i responded that i could not weigh in . ' but the inspector general 's report also cited other messages from mayorkas that were never turned over to the associated press . in one case , mayorkas forwarded a january 2013 email from rodham about delays with a high importance designation . the email would have been covered under ap 's information request since mayorkas sent it during the relevant time period and contained rodham 's name . ` staff understood these applications were getting high-level attention , ' the inspector general 's report said . virginia gov. terry mcauliffe , another democrat , was also connected to the investor proposal but later divested . his spokesman , brian coy , said the report demonstrated that mcauliffe asked the government to decide on the investment proposal in a timely fashion . the other two cases involved a hollywood investment program and an investment effort in nevada that had ties to former pennsylvania gov. ed rendell and senate democratic leader harry reid of nevada , respectively . the reid-related project was sls , a casino project that he did n't invest in but advocated strongly for as nevada 's senior senator . homeland security secretary jeh johnson said there were lessons to be learned in the inspector general 's investigation but described mayorkas in a statement as ` exceptionally conscientious , honest and patriotic . ' ` he is often impatient with our sluggish government bureaucracy , can at times be very hands-on in resolving issues and problems that are brought to his personal attention , and is always mindful that we are public servants , ' johnson said . ` ali works hard to do the right thing , and never acts , in my observation , for reasons of personal advancement or aggrandizement .

' david cameron said mr lee had transformed singapore into one of the great success stories of the modern world . mr lee was hailed as having provided a number of british prime ministers with advice over the years and was once singled out by the late margaret thatcher as the prime minister she most admired . mr cameron said : ` that singapore is today a prosperous , secure and successful country is a monument to his decades of remarkable public service . he was always a friend to britain , if sometimes a critical one , and many british prime ministers benefited from his wise advice , including me . ` lady thatcher once said that there was no prime minister she admired more than mr lee for `` the strength of his convictions , the clarity of his views , the directness of his speech and his vision of the way ahead '' . ` his place in history is assured , as a leader and as one of the modern world 's foremost statesmen . ' former prime minster sir john major said mr lee was ` one of the political giants of recent history ' . ` he was the architect of modern singapore , and led the way in changing it from a small island country in malaysia to the thriving , competitive state that it is today , punching well above its weight and admired across the world . margaret thatcher chats with lee kuan yew on the steps of 10 downing street . ` few men left a better legacy to their nation than lee kuan yew , and we may not see his like again . he really was a remarkable leader , and will be much missed by those of us who were privileged to know him and work with him . ' president barack obama also offered his condolences , calling mr lee ' a true giant of history . ' obama said in a white house statement that he appreciated lee 's wisdom , including during discussions they held on the president 's trip to singapore in 2009 when the president was formulating his asia-pacific policy . ` he was a true giant of history who will be remembered for generations to come as the father of modern singapore and as one the great strategists of asian affairs . ' u.n. secretary-general ban ki-moon said he was ` deeply saddened ' by lee 's death and australian prime minister tony abbott said the country would continue to stand shoulder to shoulder with singapore as the region saluted one of its giants . lee 's legacy includes an efficient government with little corruption , low tax rates to attract foreign investment , excellent schools and clean and safe streets , all of which have helped singapore rank consistently near the top of surveys of the most livable cities for expatriates . he faced criticism , though , for using tough tactics to consolidate power . he jailed some political rivals without trial for decades and brought defamation lawsuits against journalists and opposition politicians , which had a chilling effect on dissent . ' i had to do some nasty things , locking fellows up without trial , ' lee said in an interview with the new york times published in september 2010 . ` i 'm not saying everything i did was right . but everything i did was for an honorable purpose . ' one of his sons , lee hsien loong , is singapore 's current prime minister . he also is survived by another son , lee hsien yang , and a daughter , neurologist lee wei ling . his wife of more than 60 years , kwa geok choo , died in october 2010 . born september 23 , 1923 , lee grew up speaking english in a singapore that was part of the british colonial empire , and was known as harry during much of his early life . his university education was interrupted by the three-year japanese occupation of the island in the second world war . the queen and mr lee share a light moment together during a state banquet at the indonesian presidential palace in 1989 . mr lee shakes hands with former prime minister tony blair at 10 downing street in 2003 . ` the japanese demanded total obedience , and got it from nearly all , ' he wrote in his memoirs . ` my appreciation of governments , my understanding of power as the vehicle for revolutionary change , would not have been gained without this experience . ' after completing his studies at singapore 's raffles college , lee went to england to study law at cambridge university . there , he married kwa , a fellow student , in 1947 . he returned to singapore in 1950 and started the law firm lee & lee with his wife in 1955 . in 1954 , lee helped found the people 's action party and he became singapore 's first prime minister in 1959 when britain granted it self-governance in all matters except defense and foreign affairs . singapore declared independence from britain in 1963 , and lee , believing his island could n't survive alone , brought it into the federation of neighboring states that became malaysia . but the malay leadership asked singapore to leave after two years because of ideological differences . lee wept on national television while announcing the breakup , which he later would call one of his biggest political regrets . he then turned to governing his tiny island state , imposing strict policies that some saw as micromanaging the daily lives of singaporeans . lee outlawed the sale of chewing gum , promoted english and mandarin while banning other chinese dialects from public schools , radio and tv . he also enforced ethnic integration by controlling the makeup of public apartment buildings , where 80 percent of the population lives . lee also cracked down on organized crime and imposed harsh penalties for minor infractions , a policy that has helped singapore maintain one of the world 's lowest violent crime rates . drug couriers face mandatory hanging , vandals are sometimes caned - such as american teenager michael fay in 1994 despite a plea for leniency from president bill clinton - and litterbugs must pay a hefty fine . mr lee , who was widely admired across the political spectrum , meets with nelson mandela in 2013 .

' with its thick atmosphere and organic-rich chemistry , titan resembles a frozen version of earth several billion years ago , before life began pumping oxygen into our atmosphere . because titan is smaller than earth , its gravity does n't hold onto its gaseous envelope as tightly , so the atmosphere extends 370 miles -lrb- 595 kilometres -rrb- into space . as on earth , the climate is driven mostly by changes in the amount of sunlight that comes with the seasons , although the seasons on titan are about seven earth years long . titan 's ` water ' is liquid methane , ch4 , better known on earth as natural gas . regular earth-water , h2o , would be frozen solid on titan where the surface temperature is -180 °c -lrb- -292 °f -rrb- . with titan 's low gravity and dense atmosphere , methane raindrops could grow twice as large as earth 's raindrops . as well as this , they would fall more slowly , drifting down like snowflakes . but scientists think it rains perhaps only every few decades . one clip uses audio data collected by the huygens probe -lrb- illustrated -rrb- as it descended onto the surface of titan on 14 january 2005 . the spacecraft carried with it acoustic sensors on the huygens atmospheric structure instrument -lrb- hasi -rrb- , which recorded the surroundings as the probe descended . elsewhere , the famous sounds of comet 67p churyumov-gerasimenko , as heard by the rosetta spacecraft and philae probe , are also replayed . rosetta 's plasma consortium -lrb- rpc -rrb- recorded oscillations in the comet 's magnetic field at 40 to 50 millihertz . the ` music ' was far below the frequency heard by humans - which typically ranges from 20 hertz to 20 kilohertz - but increasing the frequencies makes the noise audible . elsewhere , the famous sounds of comet 67p churyumov-gerasimenko -lrb- pictured -rrb- , as heard by the rosetta spacecraft and philae probe , are also replayed . rosetta 's plasma consortium -lrb- rpc -rrb- recorded oscillations in the comet 's magnetic field at 40 to 50 millihertz . the landing of philae on the surface of 67p on 12 november 2014 is also heard in a brief clip , which is the actual recording of mechanical vibrations as it made its touchdown . philae subsequently bounced twice on the surface before coming to rest in an unknown location , wedged under a cliff somewhere in partial darkness . scientists at esa are hoping that the probe will wake up in the coming weeks as sunlight recharges its batteries , letting them perform more key science on the surface . philae 's first landing on the surface , seen here as pictured from the rosetta spacecraft , can be heard in a short clip . the probe then bounced twice before coming to rest in an unknown location . the recent launch of a soyuz rocket that took two european satellites into orbit can also be heard in one amazing clip . it took off from french guiana at 9.46 pm gmt on friday 27 march , carrying two satellites that will expand europe 's galileo system - a civilian-run analogue to the us-run global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- . other launches include the radar imaging satellite sentinel-1a , which is tracking earth 's environmental changes , and 1999 's xmm-newton x-ray observatory .

' a ` food source ' was identified as the cause of the outbreak , but city health department spokesman jeff moran declined to explain what the food was or how it was contaminated , citing state law that bars them from disclosing findings of investigations . wes culp , a spokesman for the state department of health , said the law prohibits disclosure of ` diseases or any records maintained as a result of any actions taken in consequence of those reports . ' ` we do not disclose information related to an investigation unless there is a public health purpose to sharing the information , ' culp said in an email . in a report two weeks prior to the outbreak , a city health department employee cited the restaurant for multiple violations , including a lack of soap and paper towels in the employee restroom , which was noted as a repeat violation . the february 10 report stated in part : ` potentially hazardous ready to eat food , prepared in the food facility and held for more than 48 hours , located in the walk in cooler , was not date marked .

' in 2010 , the health department issued a cease-and-desist order against joy tsin lau alleging ` failure to ensure that public-health standards for a safe and sanitary operation ' are being maintained . about 250 people attended the ill-fated banquet celebrating the lunar new year at the landmark chinese restaurant at 1026 race street . the owner insisted her restaurant was not the culprit , suggesting that the afflicted diners drank too much or came down with a cold . at the event , which doubled as a fundraiser for the temple university asian pacific american law student association , guests were served an eight-course dinner featuring peking duck , walnut shrimp , spare ribs , deep-fried fish and a host of other dishes . one of the patrons at the restaurant that night was david haase , a philadelphia attorney , who told daily mail online in an email friday that the mystery illness felled him 30 hours after the feast and kept him bedridden for four days . he recalled that while none of the dishes he had that night tasted ` spoiled ' per se , he noticed that nearly all of the food was barely lukewarm . ` i was disappointed with the overall quality of the food , but i did not give it too much thought because i was there to support the terrific law school organization hosting the event , ' mr haase wrote to daily mail . ` all of my colleagues at our firm 's table were similarly disappointed with the quality of the food but we just made the best of it . ' mr haase noted that their table did send back the first pot of tea because there was food crusted on the spout . the dinner was friday night . on saturday , haase piled his family into his suv and drove five hours to state college , where his 16-year-old daughter was set to compete in a track championship the following day . but at around 4am sunday , disaster struck . the lawyer , whose firm sponsors a table at the banquet every year , revealed that he suffered from a wicked combination of projectile vomiting , explosive diarrhea and intense stomach cramps that made him moan in bed . ` i have never been more sick , ' he recalled . ` vile fluids were coming out of every orifice . ' star-crossed diners : attorney david haase -lrb- left -rrb- and medical researcher jack jiang -lrb- right -rrb- were among the patrons who found themselves bedridden with food poisoning after the banquet . mr haase also addressed head-on the restaurant owner 's suggestion that perhaps the ailment was brought on by her guests overindulging in alcohol , or coming down with a cold . ` i was perfectly healthy when i attended the dinner , i was appropriately dressed in a suit and overcoat -lrb- i never ` got cold ' -rrb- , and i did not go drinking at a karaoke bar afterwards , ' he stated . fellow diner jack jiang , a medical researcher at university of pennsylvania , attended the celebration with his girlfriend . jiang recounted to philadelphia inquirer how he had spent three days in bed writhing in pain and ` exploding out of all orifices ' following the infamous dinner . david haase said that while normally he is not inclined to sue anyone , and he does not have the time to pursue legal action , he said he just might make an exception in this case and ` set aside some precious time to educate ' the owner of the restaurant .

' the report states that the emails illustrate racial , ethnic , or other forms of bias among those involved and states that the doj 's investigation yielded no indication that any of the officers or clerks involved in the emails were disciplined before this week . in fact , the report states , there were no instances discovered where recipients asked the sender to refrain from sending such emails . instead , the emails were forwarded along to others . sgt. william mudd -lrb- left -rrb- and capt. rick henke -lrb- center -rrb- resigned from their positions thursday and city court clerk mary ann twitty -lrb- right -rrb- was fired over racially charged emails discovered in the report . * the list above is highlighted emails found in the doj 's 102-page report on the ferguson police department . the investigation also found that almost all of the emails were sent during work hours through government email accounts . the report also adds that evidence found shows not only racial bias , ` but racial bias by those with considerable influence over the outcome of any given court case . ' u.s. attorney general eric holder called the doj 's report ` searing , ' saying the investigation found the ferguson community to be one where both policing and municipal court practices were found to be ` disproportionately harmful to african-american residents . ' ` this investigation found a community that was deeply polarized , ' holder said . ' a community where deep distrust and hostility often characterized interactions between police and area residents . ' a community where local authorities consistently approached law enforcement not as a means for protecting public safety but as a way to generate revenue . ' ferguson mayor james knowles said friday that the city is pursuing reforms to reach a settlement with the doj , reuters reports . the doj 's civil rights investigation into the st. louis suburb of 21,000 came after a white ferguson police officer , darren wilson -lrb- right -rrb- fatally shot an unarmed black teen , michael brown -lrb- left -rrb- on aug. 9 . the grand jury 's decision not to indict the ferguson police officer sparked nationwide protests and cast ferguson 's mostly white police force in a negative light . knowles did not comment on whether police chief tom jackson would step down , reuters reports , amid calls for the chief to do so by some community and civil rights leaders . the report highlighted the department 's practices , saying the city 's focus on revenue greatly impacts the police department 's approach to law enforcement and the role of ferguson 's municipal court . it states : ` the ferguson municipal court handles most charges brought by the fpd , and does so not with the primary goal of administering justice , or protecting the rights of the accused , but of maximizing revenue . ' the department also exhibited evidence of racial stereotyping , the report states . * the list above is highlighted evidence found in the doj 's 102-page investigation into the ferguson police department based on the department 's findings and research . the report found that some practices of the ferguson police department violate law and are unconstitutional in that they violate the fourth amendment . the report highlighted the fact that african-americans make ` extraordinary ' efforts to pay off overly expensive tickets for often minor , unfairly charged violations . court records and emails show that while african-americans struggled to pay the expensive tickets , city officials including the municipal judge , the court clerk , and department supervisors helped their friends , colleagues , and even themselves in eliminating tickets , fees , fines , and citations . the report highlighted a 2014 incident where the court clerk received an email from a relative with a scanned copy of a ticket asking for help . the clerk responded : ` your ticket of $ 200 has magically disappeared ! the report found that some practices of the ferguson police department violate law and are unconstitutional in that they violate the fourth amendment , which prohibits unreasonable searches and seizures by law enforcement and requires any warrant to be supported by probable cause .

' the emotional man 's anger only increases as dr. phil asks about nick 's sobriety . refuses to go : the 25-year-old aspiring rapper storms out when told he needs help . resigned : ultimately , gordon concedes that he needs help and leaves for a rehab facility . then , on 11 february 2012 , it was gordon who tried to resuscitate whitney when she was found unresponsive in her bath-tub just hours before she was due to attend a grammy awards party . speaking to dr phil , michelle said : ` nicholas just continually expresses how much he has failed whitney . ` he administered cpr -lsb- to whitney -rsb- and he called me when he was standing over her body . he could n't understand why he could n't revive her . he said , `` mommy why ? i could n't get the air into her lungs .

' their relationship was also very volatile . ` when whitney died nick was left with nothing , so he knew he had to control krissi to get access to the money . she 'd do whatever he told her . ` he was very manipulative and would even use the drugs to control her . they would argue a lot and there were times when he would be violent with her and push her around . ' according to stepho : ` but krissi really loved him because he was there to fill the gap left by her mother . she was not close to her father and did not have anyone else close to her . nick knew this and took advantage of it . ' troubled relationship : a friend of the couple , steven stepho , claimed the pair were using various drugs daily including heroin , xanax , pot and heroin substitute roxicodone .

' i had to change my bed every day because there would be so much skin and my eczema wept so much the sheets got all sticky . ' i itched constantly and there would be blood on the sheets too . it was just permanently painful . ' miss james , who works for a recovery firm in northampton , first suffered from a small flare up aged three . she said : ' i ca n't remember not having eczema . it started in the creases of my arms when i was little . ' the eczema gradually spread over her arms and patches appeared on the back of her knees , followed by her hands , stomach and over her legs . in her teens , the eczema progressed and by aged 15 , it had spread to her neck and her face . she said : ' i was teased for having ` lovebites ' on my neck but it was the eczema . ' i used scarves to try and cover it up but then people thought i was covering the lovebites . ' and while most distraught teenagers would reach for the foundation , miss james had no idea how to use cosmetics . she said : ' i was n't one of those girls who knew how to use make up . i did n't know how to cover it up . ` when i got to college and started going out , i just saw so many girls on nights out who were beautiful and i looked disgusting . ' i just could n't even hide it , so on a bad day i would n't even leave my room . ' i thought it was down to stress with exams . ' miss james ' eczema used to cover her entire body and caused a ` snowstorm ' when she walked . even sat at her desk , miss james was faced with problems . she said : ` at the office i would have to go to the bathroom and have a scratch for 20 minutes . ` my fashion sense went downhill because i could n't wear anything that was n't cotton . ' despite trying countless treatments , nothing worked . skin diseases such as eczema are the most common reason we go to the gp , according to figures from the british skin foundation . the condition , characterised by dry , itchy red skin , is now estimated to affect up to 20 per cent of school children and up to 10 per cent of adults . eczema is an inflammatory condition of the skin characterised by dryness and itching . the skin barrier is unable to function properly , which leads to water loss from the skin , triggering itching . bacteria readily gain entry to the skin - especially if it has been scratched - and cause infection . moisturisers or emollients are the first line in treatment and contain humectants . these contain ingredients that draw water from the lower levels of skin to rehydrate the upper levels and those which prevent further water loss from the surface while the barrier repairs . the inflammation is treated by topical steroids . oatmeal baths have long been recommended for people with sensitive skin conditions including eczema . oats have properties which meant they are able to naturally moisturise the skin and relieve itching . they also contain antioxidants which have an anti-inflammatory effect . ` i 'd used light treatment , different creams , medication , herbal remedies - i 'd tried everything , ' she said . and in desperation to keep her condition at bay , she became reliant on steroid cream , which if used incorrectly , can thin skin and increase the risk of skin infections . miss james said : ` if i had a flare up , i would use the cream all over then it would be at bay for two weeks . ` but when it came back it would be worse than ever . ' eventually , miss james came across the international topical steroid awareness network -lrb- itsan -rrb- which has research showing a link between steroid cream and worsening eczema . ' after discussing with her doctor , miss james stopped using the treatment in may 2014 and is now using other skin creams to calm the eczema . but one of the most surprising and effective treatments she has found is porridge oats . she said : ` now i make a face mask using goat 's milk and porridge oats , it 's really soothing . ' i have oat baths , you just use a pair of old tights to put the oats inside . ` the water looks disgusting but it works for me . ' her home treatment , along with anti-histamines from her gp , have cleared up her eczema on some of her body . she said : ` my face is much better now , and my stomach and legs you ca n't even tell i 've got it . ' however she still has severe eczema on her hands , neck and arms but is hopeful she will have further recovery . despite porridge having helped her , she still wears cotton whenever she can . miss james also credits her the support of her partner of six years , nicola wilson , 26 , with her progress . she said : ` people do n't realise how serious eczema is , they think it 's just red skin that 's a bit itchy ' she said : ` nicola is a teacher so she works long hours and then she comes home and looks after me . ' i ca n't bathe myself because of the condition so she washes me . ` we joke that she 's become my carer . ' however , due to the stress her body is under , and because she scratches patches of eczema on her head , for the past nine months miss james ' hair and eyebrows have been falling out . she now washes her hair just once a week -- with shampoo for thin hair and to stimulate hair growth -- so not to irritate her scalp further and cause more hair loss . she said : ' i have to be careful with my hair as it 's holding on by a thread . i think others in my condition would have shaved their heads . ` it upsets me as i got my hair really long and healthy and then one day it started to fall out . i back-comb it to cover up bald patches . i 'm trying to make the best of it . ' she added : ' i started a blog to document my journey and so many people have been supportive . ` i 'm no longer just the girl with the eczema .

' i spend a lot of time - hours and hours - it 's a big process . i do n't go on budget holidays , but i 've saved thousands of dollars by going through this process , ' he told daily mail australia . the 27-year-old said that he spent the time researching potential hotels and destinations by looking at various booking sites and reviews , adding that despite enjoying the process , he found it took up a ` ridiculous amount of time ' . ` it 's the amount of information out there . one website that will do that legwork for you and get you the best hotel prices , show you reviews and airfares all in the one currency - one true source of truth - would be ideal , ' he said . mr kelly admitted that it was during office hours that most of his searching and booking occurred , and he 's not alone . according to kayak 26 per cent of those surveyed from canberra did the same thing - a figure which almost three times the national average . it also found that 31 per cent of people have resorted to completely abandoning their travel plans and bookings due to their frustration . investment banker todd fortescue came close to doing so himself when he and his girlfriend found themselves constantly bickering after becoming frustrated with travel agents helping them with their trip to canada earlier this year . the 27-year-old said there was an information overload online and admitted that he did a lot of research for his flights and hotels while at work . instead , the couple ditched their travel agent , choosing to find their own booking deals online . ` we were getting frustrated that we were n't getting anywhere with booking and that it was costing more than we had anticipated and were thinking that maybe we should postpone it for a year when we had more time and knew exactly what we wanted , ' mr fortescue told daily mail australia . ` we went to a travel agent to get assistance and gave them an outline of what we wanted but some of them would give us all these different stories about why they did n't have accommodation in certain areas . it seemed like they were working on commission with hotels because when we looked into the areas ourselves , we found plenty of options . ` there was this constant back and forth of emails and some agents were in different time zones and the more time we wasted the more money we wasted as we got closer to the dates . it was much cheaper when we did it ourselves .

' the researchers found homeopathic treatments were no more effective than sugar pills and other control , pretend medicines to treat asthma , migraines , stress and colds . homeopathy is a form of complementary , holistic medicine used by more than 200 million people across the world . advocates advise it is used for both acute and chronic conditions . it is based on the principle of ` like cures like ' , the british homeopathic association states . the idea is that substances that cause illnesses can become remedies in small , highly diluted doses . the bha advise it can be used to treat eczema , depression , coughs , the menopause , chronic fatigue , irritable bowel syndrome , hay fever , crohn 's disease , multiple sclerosis , rheumatoid arthritis and asthma . there were signs it was more effective than placebos for adhd , bruising , hiv , chronic fatigue , ulcers and depression . but the council concluded the experiments were not carried out properly and the results were not very reliable . for a treatment to be considered effective , the council 's homeopathy working committee advised it must result in health improvements that can not be explained by the placebo effect , and these health improvements must be meaningful for a person 's overall health . there must also be evidence that the health improvements in people taking the treatment are unlikely to be due to chance and the result must be seen consistently in several studies , the council 's report said . professor anderson concluded : ` from this review , the main recommendation for australians is that they should not rely on homeopathy as a substitute for proven , effective treatments . ` this statement was the result of a rigorous examination of the evidence and used internationally accepted methods for assessing the quality and reliability of evidence for determining whether or not a therapy is effective for treating health conditions . ' homeopathic remedies are prepared by taking a substance , plant , animal or chemical material , diluting it in water or alcohol , then forcefully hitting the container against a hand or surface . the medicines come in the form of pellets to be placed under the tongue , tablets , liquids , ointments , sprays and creams . the australian health council assessed the effectiveness of homeopathic medicines based on three criteria . in the first instance , they looked at a review of past studies , carried out by an independent contractor . the council found there is no conclusive evidence that homeopathy is more effective than placebos in treating patients and easing their symptoms . advocates of the alternative medicine say it is useful in treating a range of illnesses , including multiple sclerosis , colds , coughs as well as irritable bowel syndrome . in addition , experts considered an independent evaluation of information provided by homeopathy interest groups and the public . and finally , the council took into consideration clinical practice guidelines and government reports on homeopathy , published in countries across the world . cristal sumner , chief executive of the british homeopathic association said the australian council 's report ` seriously misrepresents the nature of the clinical research evidence in homeopathy ' . ` the nhmrc 's conclusion fails to caution that the review admitted that `` the evidence base for the majority of clinical conditions was considered of insufficient size to enable clear conclusions on the efficacy of homeopathy to be drawn '' , ' she said . ` moreover , the review 's focus on medical conditions fails to recognise that homeopathy is based on individualised treatment , not on a named medical condition . ' a recent meta-analysis published by the british homeopathic association has provided independently verified evidence that individually prescribed homeopathic medicines may have clinical effects that are greater than those of placebos . ` the nhmrc 's statement also fails to note that its review commended further quality research in homeopathy .

' the charity commission started investigating both the rowntree and roddick charities over their funding of cage in 2013 . much of the rest of its income comes from cash donations from muslims . last week lord carlile , a former independent reviewer of anti-terrorism legislation , said : ` cage is an organisation with a warped view . no sensible person should be funding it . ' sources at the charity commission believe officials at rowntree may have been ` duped ' when they agreed to support cage . the mail has highlighted criticism of cage and its pronouncements about jihadi john , identified as mohammed emwazi , for the past week . in a statement rowntree said : ` in the last week we have been put under intense regulatory pressure to rule out any future funding of cage . ` in the light of regulatory pressure , and to protect the interests of all our grantees and the other work of the trust , we have decided to confirm we will not fund cage either now or in the future . ' a charity commission spokesman said : ` statements by cage officials heightened concerns about the use of charitable funds to support their activities . in these circumstances , -lsb- we -rsb- required unequivocal assurances from the two charities that they have ceased funding cage and had no intention of doing so in the future . we are glad both the roddick foundation and the joseph rowntree charitable trust have ceased funding cage .

' knox , 27 , and sollecito , 30 , stand accused of killing the british student in perugia and the italian supreme court is expected to either uphold or quash their convictions today . professor peter gill , a lecturer of forensic genetics at oslo university , norway , looked in-depth at the dna results from the crime scene using the originally analysis by the italian police scientific department and also a second independent analysis ordered by the judge in the first appeal . in an exclusive interview with the daily mail , professor gill admits that the evidence against knox and sollecito is very weak and and compares it to something out of the fictional csi tv series . he said : ` it 's very , very tenuous to use this -lsb- dna -rsb- evidence to link to the conclusion that it proves an activity such as stabbing a victim . if knoxs ' conviction is upheld she could delay going to jail if she were pregnant , according to italian legal experts . there has also been speculation that political pressure from the us could hamper the extradition process . sollecito is reportedly seeking to separate his case from knox 's , with his lawyers pointing out that a partial confession written by the american and later retracted did not mention his presence at the scene of the crime . if that argument succeeds , the italian could be given a new trial . since being convicted sollecito has deserted knox , his one-time lover , and is now insisting that their positions are ` not intertwined ' . his case should have been considered independently of knox 's , he now insists . yesterday bombshell court papers revealed that sollecito claims he does not remember whether knox was with him at the time of ms kercher 's murder . in a dramatic change in legal strategy , sollecito has cast serious doubt on foxy knoxy 's alibi , with the italian now saying he ca n't be sure she was at his house for the whole of the night on which the british student was brutally murdered . all the evidence against the former couple points to knox , sollecito claims in papers filed by his lawyers in advance of the make-or-break supreme court hearing today . ms kercher , a 21-year-old student from coulsdon , surrey , -lrb- left -rrb- was found with her throat slit in her bedroom in perugia in 2007 . knox -lrb- right -rrb- is appealing a decision reinstating what was her conviction for killing kercher . rudy guede is serving a 16-year sentence for his involvement in kercher 's death after a separate trial . the house in perugia where british student meredith kercher was murdered aged just 21 in november 2007 . supporters of amanda knox are convinced that her guilty verdict for murder will be upheld by the italian supreme court when they make their decision later this week . american amanda knox and italian raffaele sollecito both stand accused of killing british student meredith kercher and have been tried three times for the crime . the last hearing , in january last year , again found them guilty . knox 's legal team has been warned that this decision is likely to be rubber-stamped by the supreme court today . people close to the case do not believe ms knox stands a chance in the hugely-divisive case . one supporter said they were prepared for the ` greatest miscarriage of justice ' that has ever happened to a us citizen . in their previous two trials , knox maintained that they were together at sollecito 's flat on the night of the murder after which miss kercher , 21 , was found half-naked with her throat slit in the cottage she shared with knox in perugia , italy . in an a-z of reasons for distancing his position from hers , sollecito 's lawyers are attempting to demonstrate that the evidence used against knox does not concern him . in the 306-page paper , sollecito claims that his computer records prove he was watching the japanese manga cartoon naruto at the time of the alleged murder . but he is not sure whether knox was at his house for the whole night as he had been smoking marijuana . the document says : ` the defence intends to emphasise that sollecito has always shown himself to be extraneous to the crime , and has always said that that night he did not move from his own home . however , he did not rule out that knox could have gone out .

' he took three deep breaths , then began snoring loudly . the snores became progressively quiet , and all movement stopped within less than a minute . the sister of his victim was among witnesses watching through a window . he never looked at her . his own sister and a female friend cried as they watched in an adjacent room . vasquez 's lawyers filed no late appeals to delay his execution for the 1998 slaying of 51-year-old juanita ybarra . evidence at vasquez 's 1999 capital murder trial showed he and two other men were carrying out orders to kill 51-year-old juanita ybarra for ignoring the mexican mafia 's 10 per cent street tax on drugs -- known as a ` dime . ' ` i 'm sure she was told if you 're selling , you 've got to pay the tax , ' said mary green , an assistant bexar county district attorney who prosecuted vasquez .

' murder charges against lane now depend on whether the child was alive outside of the 26-year-old expectant mother 's womb , the district attorney 's office said last week . boulder county district attorney stanley l. garnett said : ` the issue of whether or not murder charges are appropriate involving a case involving the death of a fetus or a late-term pregnancy is always a difficult issue . ` under colorado law , essentially , there 's no way murder charges can be brought if it 's not established that the fetus lived as a child outside the body of the mother for some period of time .

' the former bbc director general added : ` even if you decide to keep jeremy ... what happens next ? ' clarkson allegedly believes that the bbc have launched a ` smear campaign ' against him which he ` wo n't let go ' . sources close to the 54-year-old have said he is likely to take action against the corporation for wrongful dismissal , if he is not reinstated to the programme . it comes amid reports that the bbc are filming a pilot of a new motoring show called the getaway car , which will see contestants travel abroad to take part in driving challenges . clarkson was suspended two weeks ago following allegations of ' a fracas ' , prompting the top-rating show to be pulled off air . the four top gear roadshows scheduled for norway next weekend have been postponed . tickets for the postponed shows cost between # 42 and # 100 , meaning the decision could cost the bbc more than # 1million in lost revenue if clarkson is sacked and the shows are not rescheduled . sacking clarkson could mean the end of top gear , which makes the bbc millions every year . speculation about his future has been mounting and will be decided this week when the corporation 's internal investigation into his behaviour is handed over to the director-general . the bbc 's internal inquiry into clarkson 's fracas with mr oisin is expected to made public as soon as tuesday . it is being led by ken macquarrie , the head of bbc scotland who oversaw the investigation into the disastrous newsnight edition that falsely accused the late conservative peer lord mcalpine of being involved in the north wales child abuse scandal . the presenter launched an extraordinary foul-mouthed rant at bbc bosses during a charity gala last week . speaking at an event in north london to raise money to help disadvantaged youths , clarkson said that he wanted to do one more lap of the show 's track ` before the ` f ****** b ******* sack me ' . he said : ' i did n't foresee my sacking , but i would like to do one last lap . so i 'll go down to surrey and i 'll do one last lap of that track before the f ****** b ******* sack me . ` i 'll be a bit tearful when i do it , but f *** it , let 's do it . and i 'll drive somebody around in whatever i can get hold of . i 'm sacked so it 's probably an austin maestro . ' but the under-fire presenter claimed that the ` sweary ' incident had all been in good humour . writing in his column in the sunday times , he said : ' i woke up after a night at a charity do to be told by my lawyer that someone had uploaded a video of me using choice language to describe bosses at the bbc . ` but it was all meant in jest and anyway it worked . by being brief , controversial and a bit sweary i woke the room up and the auction prize i was offering - one last lap of the top gear test track - raised # 100,000 . ' clarkson , pictured with co ho-hosts james may and richard hammond at a top gear live show in prague , will not be performing at the four events in norway as they have been cancelled . clarkson was suspended two weeks ago following allegations of ' a fracas ' with top gear producer oisin tymon -lrb- right -rrb- , prompting the top-rating show to be pulled off air . the top gear frontman revealed that he has been ` put on silence ' which is why he has been refusing to comment on the allegations . he said : ` i 've been put on silence . there are very good reasons from my point of view why i simply ca n't say a word . ' insiders suggested clarkson and mr tymon had given ` quite different ' versions of events . sources close to mr tymon say he was punched and left with a split lip , while clarkson has admitted some ` handbags and pushing ' but is understood to have denied anything worse . the bbc was given a reminder of the strength of support behind clarkson when a million-strong petition calling for his reinstatement was delivered to its headquarters - by tank . the vehicle , apparently driven by the motoring show 's enigmatic professional driver the stig , made its way from westminster , through central london and towards new broadcasting house near oxford street . fans were pictured rallying to support the delivery of the change.org petition , started by political website guido fawkes . there is also said to be a growing realisation within the corporation that it was a mistake to take top gear -- worth # 50million a year to bbc coffers -- off the air while the investigation was under way . the petition , launched last week , reads : ` we the undersigned petition the bbc to reinstate jeremy clarkson . freedom to fracas . #bringbackclarkson ' . ' it emerged yesterday that a report into clarkson 's behaviour was commissioned by bbc head of tv danny cohen after a series of other scandals last year . top gear caused an international incident after driving through argentina with a number plate allegedly linked to the falklands war and used the word ` slope ' describe an asian man . a report into the cases apparently concluded that top gear should have a new producer role to act as a go-between the show 's team and the bbc 's management to help deal with any future crisis . the bbc today refused to comment on the report or its conclusions . there is also said to be a growing realisation within the corporation that it was a mistake to take top gear -- worth # 50million a year to bbc coffers -- off the air while the investigation was under way . ` the programme could and should have carried on during clarkson 's suspension , ' said an insider . ` jeremy wants to stay with the programme and one possible way of him doing that would be if he could face up to his own shortcomings . ` he has a great deal of public support ... but he does need to rest and sort himself out . ' david cameron 's 11-year-old daughter nancy has gone on hunger strike in protest at the presenter 's suspension from top gear . she has threatened not to eat until the presenter was restored to the bbc one show . mr cameron said : ` nancy has threatened to go on hunger strike unless jeremy clarkson is restored . ` we told her that this is not necessarily a useful intervention - he 's not exactly gandhi .

<s> bakery owned by christian family refused to make gay marriage cake . </s> <s> they have been accused of discrimination by gay rights campaigners . </s> <s> court case starts examining whether bakery discriminated over the issue . </s> <s> lawyer for equality campaigners says religious refusal was unlawful . </s><summ-content>gareth lee -lrb- pictured leaving court today -rrb- said he was left ` shocked ' and in ` disbelief ' when the bakery refused his order . a christian baker who refused to make a cake bearing a pro-gay marriage slogan has begun a court battle over equality laws . belfast-based ashers bakery refused to make a cake featuring an image of sesame street puppets bert and ernie below the motto ` support gay marriage ' . northern ireland 's equality commission is now supporting a legal action against the family-run bakery on behalf of gay rights activist gareth lee , whose order was declined . mr lee told a court today he was left ` shocked ' and in ` disbelief ' when one of the owners of the bakery , karen mcarthur , rang him and told him she would not be processing the order he had already paid for . ` it made me feel i 'm not worthy , a lesser person and to me that was wrong , ' he said . opening the case , robin allen qc , representing mr lee , said the baker 's objection on religious grounds was not lawful . he said baking a cake did not mean the bakers supported any message the cake might carry and compared the baking of a cake to a postman delivering a letter or a printer printing a poster . ' a postman taking a letter to the door or a printer carrying out a printing job - nobody would say that involved promoting or support , ' he said . ` it 's simply a functional relationship , a working relationship . ' the lawyer also noted the publicity around the case and highlighted that politicians , church figures , bloggers and others had expressed opinions on the matter . but the barrister insisted the case must be judged on the facts alone , saying : ` law must not be determined by those who shout loudest . ' mr allen qc said he was not in court to challenge the mcarthur family 's faith and highlighted that the proposed design would not have had an ashers logo on it . the case is being heard at belfast county court by district judge isobel brownlie . the commission , which monitors compliance with equality laws in the region , has alleged that the stance of the company was in breach of legislation . the case has sharply divided public opinion in northern ireland and beyond . in the wake of the bakery 's refusal to provide the service last may , the commission , a state-funded watchdog body , took on the case on behalf of mr lee . initially , the commission asked the bakery to acknowledge that it had breached legislation and offer ` modest ' damages to the customer . claims of discrimination were made after a christian-run bakery in northern ireland refused to make a cake with a pro-gay marriage slogan on it on religious grounds . pictured , left : the design . pictured , right : belfast councillor andrew muir cutting the cake which was eventually made by another bakery . ashers bakery general manager daniel mcarthur , supported by his wife amy -lrb- right -rrb- , has said he is fighting the case to allow christian business owners to follow their beliefs in how they run their firms . when ashers , which is owned by the mcarthur family , refused , the commission proceeded with the legal action . outlining his view of the facts , mr allen said mr lee had used the bakery in royal avenue in belfast city centre ` regularly ' before the incident . he said his client had seen a leaflet in the shop advertising a service whereby images could be printed in edible icing on a cake . he said there was nothing on the leaflet which suggested a limitation on the service due to ` religious scruples ' . the barrister told the court that the order was accepted by ashers director karen mcarthur and mr lee paid for it in full . ' a contract was therefore concluded , ' he said . mr allen said that , over the next few days , mrs mcarthur expressed concern about the requested cake design with her daughter-in-law , amy , and the matter was then discussed with her son , daniel . after that mr lee was informed that his order would not be processed due to the family 's religious views , said the lawyer . a court was told that for the bakery to refuse to make the cake was like a postman refusing to deliver letters . mr allen said if companies were allowed to break contracts with individuals then ` the law is worth nothing ' . he added : ` the rule of law says there shall be no discrimination in the commercial sphere . ' the barrister insisted that ashers was not an ` explicitly religious ' business and referred to an interview daniel mcarthur gave to a newspaper in which he claimed the majority of his 60-plus workforce were unaware of his family 's faith . mr allen stressed the importance of anti-discrimination legislation in northern ireland , given its history of sectarian strife . daniel and amy mcarthur sat on one side of an almost packed courtroom , with mr lee watching from the other side . the ashers case has prompted the democratic unionist party to propose a law change at stormont that would provide an ` equality clause ' which would essentially enable businesses to refuse to provide certain services on religious grounds . mr mcarthur has previously said : mr mcarthur has previously insisting that christians should be able to apply their beliefs to the day-to-day running of their businesses . he said : ' i would like the outcome of this to be that any christians running a business could be allowed to follow their christian beliefs and principles in the day-to-day running of the business and that they are allowed to make decisions based on that . ' the hearing continues . mr mcarthur , with his wife amy and daughter robyn , sat in court today to hear the legal argument .

' . ` obviously , i wanted to go to hospital some time ago . i waited 20 minutes for colella while alone in the ambulance .

' she told the hearing she had thought he was ` just having a joke ' when he earlier asked her whether she fancied a haircut , and added that he could do with a trim himself . the panel heard that he delayed the ambulance leaving for hospital by between five and ten minutes . chairman of the panel , gillian fleming , said members of the public would be ` shocked ' to know a paramedic could show such disregard for his patients saying his ` fitness to practise was impaired ' . ms fleming added that they do not know if colella , who joined the london ambulance service in 1996 , has since continued to work as a paramedic . ms fleming said today : ` whilst it appears no harm was caused , the potential impact of the registrant 's actions could have had serious consequences for the patients . ` the registrant 's actions may indicate an attitudinal problem which he appears to have taken no real steps to address . ` there 's no evidence to suggest his behaviour has changed . ' ms fleming said colella would be struck off the hcpc register with immediate effect , adding : ` the registrant has shown little in the way of insight or remorse . ` the panel considers that a striking off order is the only appropriate and proportionate order in this case .

' he said that the decision to evacuate the red lodge ski area was made about 2:30 p.m. saturday as a precautionary move and because there was just one road for firefighters and skiers to use . the evacuations have since been lifted , and gildehaus said people were free to return to the ski area . he said the winds had eased somewhat and were expected to continue that course through the night . gildehaus was n't sure how many people had been evacuated , but he estimated about 500 . the resort posted on its facebook page that guests were safe and being escorted down the mountain by law enforcement . red lodge mountain resort ski area had an evacuation order on saturday that was lifted . the us forest service said that no structures had been damaged in the blaze thus far -lrb- file photo -rrb- . it plans on being open sunday . the fire burned around rural homes , but no structures were damaged , gildehaus said . with still no containment by saturday night , the blaze had more than tripled from the 200 acres reported earlier in the day . wildfires in the area at this time of year are unusual , he said . ` but down in the low elevation , there is n't any snow and things are pretty dry , ' gildehaus said . ` we have n't really had any green-up yet where grasses turn green . we got all the dry grass from last year , and things are pretty dry .

' the small area in the brain called the visual word form area is found in the left side of the visual cortex , opposite the fusiform face area on the right side , which remembers how faces look . the study published in the journal of neuroscience looked at the brain activity of 25 adults who had learn a set of 150 nonsense words . for the research the part of the brain associated with learning was examined using functional magnetic resonance imaging -lrb- fmri -rrb- , before and after participants learnt the new words . using the fmri-rapid adaptation , the team found the visual word form area changed as the participants learned the nonsense words . before learning the words , neurons responded as though the training words were nonsense words . however over time , the neurons began to respond as though they were learning real words . the researchers said this shows the brain is ` holistically tuned ' to recognise complete words , and may also provide insights into how to help people with reading disabilities . dr riesenhuber added : ` one area is selective for a whole face , allowing us to quickly recognise people , and the other is selective for a whole word , which helps us read quickly .

' the researchers said the study shows how the brain processes words , but may also provide insights into how to help people with reading disabilities . dr riesenhuber said : ` for people who can not learn words by phonetically spelling them out - which is the usual method for teaching reading - learning the whole word as a visual object may be a good strategy . ' in particular , the team found the visual word form area in the fusiform gyrus -lrb- shown in purple -rrb- changed as the participants learned the ` nonsense ' words . the neurons began by responding to the training words as if they were nonsense , but over time , these neurons began to respond as though they were learning real words . following a previous study carried out by the team published in 2009 , the researchers were contacted by a number of people who had experienced reading difficulties and teachers helping people with reading difficulties , all saying that learning word as visual objects had helped a great deal . that study showed the existence of a neural representation for whole written real words - also known as an orthographic lexicon . the latest research now shows how novel words can become incorporated after learning into this lexicon . dr riesenhuber said : ` the visual word form area does not care how the word sounds , just how the letters of the word look together . ` the fact that this kind of learning only happens in one very small part of the brain is a nice example of selective plasticity in the brain .

' the purported joke was a reference to ireland 's religious and political divide which was at the heart of the troubles , the violence which killed 3,000 from the late 1960s until the start of the millennium . orange is the color associated with the protestant majority in northern ireland , and overcoming sectarian tensions has been a major part of the effort to bring peace to the once-deeply troubled province . enda kenny , the irish prime minister -- whose official title is taoiseach -- and his wife fionnuala kenny , the guests of honour , both laughed nervously . they said nothing , but continued to smile for the cameras . scroll down for video . wearing of the green : from left ireland 's prime minister enda kenny , his wife fionnuala and vice-president joe biden . the vice president made a joke about sectarianism and got her name wrong . i 'm with ... : vice president joe biden points at shamrock worn in his breast pocket to mark st patrick 's day . after a brief pause , mr biden declared : ` only joking . ' he then welcomed the kennys , irish ambassador anne anderson and the irish entourage into the naval observatory in washington , his official residence . the vice pesident made no further reference to his blurted-out bad joke , but at one point in his breakfast remarks appeared to refer to the taoiseach 's wife as ` fiona ' , although he subsequently corrected it to fionnuala . northern irish protestants traditionally wear orange during their annual summer parades , while green is used as a symbol by mostly catholic irish nationalists and is a theme of st patrick 's day celebrations around the world . in northern ireland , there was an immediate demand from a senior unionist for an apology . ` whether they were intended as a joke or not , the comments are a slur on those who would be known as ` orange ' i.e. protestants , ' said the rev william mccrea , a member of the british parliament for the democratic unionist party . ` when northern ireland is making such an effort to make st patrick 's day an inclusive celebration , joe biden 's comments were disgraceful and careless , ' he added . asked about the request for an apology , an official in biden 's office said the vice president had made clear that he was joking . biden 's mother , catherine finnegan , was of irish origin . her ancestors had moved to ireland in the wake of the potato famine . the vice president made another minor blunder later when he read a quote from a yeats poem he described as ` easter sunday 1916 ' , when the word sunday is not in the title . the poem was about the easter rising , when irish rebels began a violent attempt to force ireland to become independent from the united kingdom , which succeeded five years later . it actually broke out the next day , easter monday , april 24 of that year . the use of easter sunday would materially affect the subject of the poem , best known for its phrase ' a terrible beauty is born ' . he described yeats as ' a protestant hero in a predominantly catholic country . ' he then told the taoiseach : ` you 've become a close friend and i admire you a great deal . ' laughing : despite the gaffe , irish prime minister enda kenny laughed with mr biden . mr biden also revealed that he had a stammer as a child . ` my uncle , ed finnegan , a bachelor , used to sleep in the same room as my brother and i. i used to stutter very badly when i was a kid . but at night ed used to recite the poetry of yeats . and i would get up and recite in front of a mirror , and try to learn not to contort my face when i spoke and stuttered . ' mr biden has a long list of previous gaffes -- he once asked a wheelchair-bound local politician to stand up and acknowledge the crowd 's applause , and after being chosen as vice president he even suggested that hillary clinton would have been a better choice . most recently he was widely ridiculed for putting his hands on the shoulders of stephanie carter , wife of defense secretary ash carter , and whispering in her ear as her husband was sworn in . he also told the father of a teenage girl -- utah republican senator orrin hatch 's grandaughter emily -- that he hoped he had a ` big fence ' as hatch was sworn in . five years ago , biden incorrectly suggested at a st patrick 's day reception that the mother of then irish prime minister brian cowen was dead , saying ` god rest her soul ' , before correcting himself to say ` god bless her soul ' . at today 's washington event the taoiseach presented the vice president with a book of yeats ' poetry , but told him he should not open it for at least another 25 years , ` when you are old and grey and nodding by the fire . ' he then invited mr biden to play a round of golf in ireland - the fifth time he has done so , with no success so far . mr kenny joked : ` the golf courses are still there . and they are in better condition than they have been for many years . so welcome home , finnegan . ' mr biden replied that last year the taoiseach had tried to intercede for him with the president , telling him , ` you got ta let him go . you got ta let joe go . '

' i just looked around and thought this is absolutely crazy - i can not believe this is happening right now . ` we do all sorts of activities from show-and-tell to dress-up ; we also play with play-doh have snack and nap time . ` it really is a preschool for adults and everybody loves it . ' the classes , which are priced between $ 333 and $ 999 for a month-long course , depending on what each adult is able to pay , have been taking place once a week throughout the month of march , and are scheduled during the evenings , so that any working adult participants are still able to attend , after completing a full day at the office . and , just like a traditional preschool , pupils get the chance to enjoy a class picture day , a slumber party and even a parents ' evening where they can show off their work . ` it 's amazing , we say `` it 's snack time '' and everyone is like `` yay , snack time '' - then its nap time and everybody cuddles up together in a ball , ' michelle added . ` they totally get into it -- it 's really great getting in there and making things with play-doh and loving it . ' interestingly , the adults who attend michelle 's classes confess that they feel no embarrassment about taking the opportunity to revert back to their childhood selves - and some even insist that the classes serve as a perfect way of inject more fun into their lives . put it all together : the classes are run by michelle -lrb- pictured -rrb- , who goes by the name of miss joni during school hours . daring duo : michelle -lrb- r -rrb- and her assistant miss cancan -lrb- l -rrb- both have a background in early child development . tuneful melody : the preschool program also includes music lessons for participants . lawyer amanda devereux , 33 is one such participant , and admitted that she attends the classes because they provide her with a forum in which she can try new things and experience some of the fun she used to enjoy as a child . ` i 'm a litigator , i deal with securities litigation and complex commercial cases , ' she explained . ` this is definitely a contrast from my job but i would like to think i 'm a lot like i was when i was a child . ' i still like to have fun and try new things . ` my family are really into the idea and my work colleagues are not surprised i 've taken the class . ` my mother just sent me a sweater for -lsb- my -rsb- class picture day with a note saying she used to pick out my clothes when i was four , so why not now ? ' along with lawyers from the corporate sector , the class also attracts mothers who want a break from their everyday obligations at home . sarah fader , 35 , an author and mother-of-two , explained that attending the quirky preschool allows her to embrace her own inner child , after spending a day looking after the needs of her own children at home . ` being a mom and taking care of children is very taxing , ' she said . ' i wanted to get back to that feeling of freedom and childlike fun and wonder that i used to have . ` my children are seven and four and doing this grown up preschool reminds me of what it must be like as a child and helps me become a better parent . ' free and fun : michelle believes that the classes serve as a form of therapy for the adults . artistic expression : the adult attendees are even allowed to finger paint on the walls . secret success : michelle believes that each pupil at her preschool needs the chance to escape from their adult obligations . preschool mastermind creator michelle believes that , for many of her participants , the classes serve as a form of therapy , allowing adults to deal with their real world problems from the point of view of their inner child . ` my hope is that everyone who participates in preschool mastermind really comes out with a new sense of looking at the world with curiosity , with imagination and they are able to see things differently , ' she said . ` part of this is finding the secret to getting adults to get out of their normal routine and start playing more . ' with parents day currently on the horizon , michelle added that all of her pupils are being encouraged to bring along their own parents , or their friends and family members , to share with them everything that they have achieved during their classes . ` on parents day they will either have their parents or their friends here and they 'll get to show off in a big show-and-tell showcase , ' michelle added . but while michelle 's classes have gone down a storm with her pupils , they have also , perhaps unsurprisingly , garnered some unwanted attention from prospective pupils who have misunderstood exactly what the classes are about . ` we have had some adults inquiring about changing diapers and if this is all about adult baby play - but that is not what this is , ' michelle explained . ` there is nothing sexual about this class it 's just fun . ` there are some people that think this is a waste of time and a waste of money - they say they can finger paint on their own . ` to them i would say go and finger paint on your own -- i hope you do . freedom of expression : according to michelle , the participants at her preschool are looking to find ` more magic in life ' select group : michelle admitted that the classes have received some criticism , but added that she is aware her preschool program ` is not for everybody ' ` it 's fine that people criticise this -- it 's not for everybody . ` people come because they want to stop being so serious all the time and want to learn and have that fun come to them and they want to find more magic in life . ' while the classes might seem like a bit of a folly for pupils , both michelle , and her assistant miss cancan , boast an impressive background in early child development - and both have experience in preschool education . ` something you may not know about me is that i have nearly half a degree in early childhood education , ' michelle explains on her website . ' i wanted to be a preschool teacher for many years , so that is what i originally went to college for ! i love preschoolers , and we connect on a serious level . ` but then i realized that career path meant being chained to a classroom and told that my butt ca n't show ... so i switched to fashion merchandising . ' she adds : ' -lsb- miss cancan -rsb- used to be a preschool teacher abroad and has fantastic insights , puns , a master 's in teaching , and imagination . ' but despite her enthusiasm for the class and her pupils , michelle remains realistic about how some people will view her grown up preschool . she added : ` for those of you who say this is a weird thing to do , i would say you are probably right .

' they also note that ejections of material associated with the flare - known as a coronal mass ejection -lrb- cme -rrb- - are predicted to arrive today and tomorrow . ` the combined effects of these storms have prompted a g1 -lrb- minor -rrb- geomagnetic storm watch to be issued , with the possibility of additional or upgraded watches if/when additional data can be analysed , ' they wrote . a geomagnetic storm is a temporary disturbance of earth 's atmosphere , which can cause communication problems . nasa 's solar dynamics observatory -lrb- sdo -rrb- , illustration shown , was launched on 11 february 2010 and has observed the sun ever since . it 's goal is to understand how exactly the sun interacts with the environment around earth . it captured the images of this latest large flare . according to the us space weather prediction centre -lrb- swpc -rrb- in boulder , colorado , the flare -lrb- shown -rrb- caused an hour-long blackout in some high-frequency radio communicatiosn over some areas . a solar flare occurs when magnetic energy that has built up in the solar atmosphere is suddenly released - mostly in the active regions around sunspots . their frequency varies from several a day , when the sun is particularly active , to less than one a week during quiet periods . radiation is emitted across virtually the entire electromagnetic spectrum , from radio waves at the long wavelength end , through optical emission to x-rays and gamma rays at the short wavelength end . the amount of energy released is the equivalent of millions of 100-megaton hydrogen bombs exploding at the same time . solar flares are not to be confused with coronal mass ejections -lrb- cmes -rrb- . the former are the flash of light from the sun , while the latter are the actual emission of material that we often see as ` loops ' coming from the surface . while the two often accompany each other , the relationship between them is not entirely understood .

<s> us researchers say some parents are introducing children to alcohol early . </s> <s> the idea is to lessen its taboo appeal by following the ` european model ' </s> <s> uk study says kids are more likely to drink after seeing parents get drunk . </s><summ-content>children offered a sip of their parents ' wine at parties and social occasions are more likely to start drinking by their mid-teens , researchers warn . children offered a sip of their parents ' wine at parties and social occasions are more likely to start drinking by their mid-teens , researchers warn . a study has found that those who had sipped alcohol by the age of 11 were five times more likely to have had a full drink within a couple of years , and four times more likely to have binged or been drunk than peers who had not tasted alcohol at an early age . the study was carried out in the us where , say researchers , some parents try to lessen the taboo appeal of drinking by following the ` european model ' of introducing young children to alcohol under supervision at home . lead researcher kristina jackson , of brown university in rhode island , said : ` our study provides evidence to the contrary . ' previous research suggests parental attitudes are one of the most important factors involved in when teens start drinking . a survey of uk schoolchildren found witnessing drinking at home and seeing their parents get drunk raises the risk of children having an alcoholic drink by the age of 13 . in the american study , 561 rhode island middle-school students were surveyed periodically over three years . at the beginning of sixth grade -- around the age of 11 -- almost 30 per cent of pupils said they had sipped alcohol . in most cases , their parents provided it -- often at a party or other special occasion . by the time the students reached the ages of 14 and 15 , one in four early ` sippers ' said they had had a full alcoholic drink , compared with 6 per cent of those who had not . almost one in ten of early sippers had got drunk or binged -- compared with just under 2 per cent of ` non-sippers ' , says a report in the journal of studies on alcohol and drugs . researchers accounted for several factors which influence under-age drinking , including parents ' drinking habits and any history of alcoholism , as well as tendencies among the children to be impulsive and take risks . even then there was still a connection between early sipping and risky drinking by high school , said dr jackson . she said it was possible little tastes of alcohol sent young children a mixed message because some may have difficulty understanding the difference between a sip of wine and having a full drink . she stressed parents should not be alarmed if they had already let their child have a taste of wine , adding : ` we 're not saying your child is doomed . ' dr paul wallace , of the charity drinkaware , said : ` alcohol can harm children while they are still developing which is why the uk chief medical officers say an alcohol-free childhood as the best option . ` it 's best to talk to your child about the risks associated with drinking . you have more influence than you might think . ' one in five teenagers have bought or tried electronic cigarettes , a major british study has found . this includes many who had never smoked regular cigarettes . it is feared youngsters hooked on the nicotine in the devices will then move on to tobacco cigarettes , putting themselves at risk of lung cancer and other diseases . experts warn that rather than being an aid to quitting smoking , e-cigarettes are increasingly seen as ` a recreational drug in their own right ' . professor mark bellis , of liverpool john moores university , surveyed 16,000 people aged 14 to 17 in the north west of england . a fifth said they had bought or tried e-cigarettes . more boys than girls had done so , and the rate increased among those from deprived areas , the journal bmc public health reports . professor bellis warned nicotine can affect younger brains more seriously .

' the federal aviation administration -lrb- faa -rrb- in the us last week approved amazon 's plan to begin testing drones for online deliveries , though the e-commerce firm first made the request in july last year . but in the time it took to approve the use of its first-generation drone , amazon has developed a new version , which makes the ruling ` obsolete ' . so the firm is setting its sights on foreign markets . the project , called amazon prime air , was first revealed in a youtube video in late 2013 . the company is developing drones that can fly at speeds of 50 miles per hour -lrb- 80 kph -rrb- , operate autonomously and sense and avoid objects . amazon 's paul misener wrote in a letter to the faa in december : ` without approval of our testing in the united states , we will be forced to continue expanding our prime air r&d footprint abroad . ' under us law , operating drones for commercial purposes is illegal , however it is allowed in the uk if permission is granted by the civil aviation authority -lrb- caa -rrb- . the faa is said to be currently reviewing its rules on drones , with new regulations expected to be announced in the near future . amazon is developing aerial vehicles as part of amazon prime air . the aircraft can travel at more than 50mph and carry loads of up to 5 pounds -lrb- 2kg -rrb- . about 86 per cent of amazon 's deliveries are five lbs or less , the company said . ` we believe customers will love it , and we are committed to making prime air available to customers worldwide as soon as we are permitted to do so , ' amazon has said . in the us , the flying of unmanned aircraft , including recreational drones , is banned above 400ft -lrb- 122m -rrb- . any flight that takes place within five miles -lrb- 8km -rrb- of an airport can also only occur once air traffic control has been notified . the uk 's caa has laid out guidelines for drone users that specify that unmanned aircraft must always be flown within the ` line of sight ' of the pilot , which it generally measures at 1,600 ft -lrb- 488m -rrb- horizontally and 400ft -lrb- 122m -rrb- vertically . this remains a stumbling block for amazon and other companies as it means they would only be able to deliver items within 1,600 ft -lrb- 488m -rrb- of their warehouses . so far , law enforcement of drone regulation breaches in the uk appear to have been relatively tolerant . chief inspector nick aldworth , of the metropolitan police , told a house of lords select committee on piloted aircraft systems that tourists had been caught flying drones in parts of central london , despite laws restricting use close to buildings and congested areas . ` we have decided not to enforce the legislation that exists , even though they were in contravention of it , because it did not seem proportionate , ' he said . chinese internet giant alibaba is also currently carrying out its own private trials of drone technology for deliveries . a new website allows homeowners to register the sky above their property as a no fly zone for drones . ` noflyzoneuk.org is the first site in the uk to introduce the vast benefits which the drone industry will inevitably bring , ' says john tansley , its managing director . ` in fact the service is intended to benefit the public , the drone industry and the uk government . ` our hope is that in allowing the public to request that their property become a no fly zone , then this will address the privacy concerns which have been mooted by the relevant authorities .

' beautiful boy : john relaxing with son sean lennon at their dakota apartment . hanging out : the couple , in the new york living room , loved living in the city . at work : the couple worked intensely for over a month , recording 28 songs - 14 of john 's and 14 of yoko 's . the concept of double fantasy was a back-and-forth dialogue , a kind of musical conversation between them . george harrison was deeply shocked by his bandmate 's murder but had had little contact with him in the years prior to the murder . broken up emotionally , ringo starr and his wife , barbara bach , immediately flew to new york to offer comfort to yoko . ` they were two people in one , ' ringo said . lennon was the unofficial leader of the beatles , ` the cheeky wit and sardonic soul of the beatles ' , newsweek wrote in 2014 . his death was the end of an era . yoko remembers the last time the couple went into the studio together in 1978 , the hit factory in new york . yoko introduces the collection of photos in the book . ` when john and i decided to make the album double fantasy , breaking a five-year silence , we wondered whom we should ask to take the photographs . as the two of us thought about it , suddenly the face of kishin shinoyama came to mind . ' i said , `` for once , i 'd really like to have a japanese photographer . '' john quickly agreed , saying , `` right , that sounds good . '' i never expected that `` for once '' would turn out to be the last album john and i made together , and that `` for once '' would live on forever ' . kishin shinoyama remembers that last recording session : ' i checked in at the hotel lexington , and by early afternoon i was down the street at the door of the hit factory on west 48th street , the recording studio where john and yoko were working on the final parts of the record , inserting choruses and other additional layers of sounds . ` the two had been working intensely for over a month , recording 28 songs -- 14 of john 's and 14 of yoko 's . the concept of double fantasy was a back-and-forth dialogue , a kind of musical conversation between them . ` as i entered the studio , the atmosphere was of creativity and concentration . yoko greeted me and immediatelyintroduced me to john . he was slim and dressed all in black . his demeanor was very sweet , gentle ... almost tender . he welcomed me warmly and then returned his attention to four backup singers , directing them as they laid down the chorus to a song he had written called `` woman '' . chill : john was trying to clear away those feelings - of fame , of the past - in order to become a new person , says the photographer . ` throughout the sessions , i noticed that john always spoke with the staff and the studio musicians in a quiet , clear manner , remaining calm and focused , despite the seemingly endless days and nights of work . overall , there was a feeling of both relief and exhaustion in the air , a sense that this important and cathartic project was finally nearing completion ' . while dining later at mr chow 's , kishin learned that he and john were both 40 years old.john revealed ` he was at a turning point , that he wanted to forget everything that had come before and start again ' , kishin writes . ` he was trying to clear away those feelings -- of fame , of the past -- in order to become a new person . ` he explained to me that without yoko , he would n't be there now - that the first part of his life he had been obsessed with alcohol and women and drugs , and that yoko had been the first woman to tell him that what he was obsessed with was meaningless . ` he felt that those words had changed him , and this new album was going to celebrate that change ' . a month after kishin returned to japan , john was shot and killed . ' i look back at these photos , so many years later , and i feel that i captured john and yoko at their happiest moment . they were doing creative work , working on the album , recording together . and they were raising their son and loving each other and living a full life together , ' kishin offers . ` it was such a lucky time for me to be there , a moment of unclouded happiness for john and yoko .

<s> beyonce set to take coveted leading role in latest version of a star is born . </s> <s> she will follow the lead of actresses judy garland and barbra streisand . </s> <s> the singer considers it to be a chance to win herself an academy award . </s><summ-content>beyonce is set to take the coveted leading role in the latest version of a star is born . it 's the leading role that has crowned the career of some of hollywood 's finest actresses . and now beyoncé is set to follow in the footsteps of judy garland and barbra streisand by taking the coveted part in the latest version of a star is born . the film would provide beyoncé , 33 , with her biggest role yet , playing an unknown who rises to stardom as her famous husband 's career spirals downwards . the movie will be directed by american sniper actor bradley cooper , who is also expected to play the leading man . the female lead was first created by janet gaynor in the original 1937 version , appearing with fredric march . the movie was remade in 1954 with james mason and garland -- who , like gaynor , was rewarded with a best actress oscar nomination -- and again in 1976 with streisand and kris kristofferson . ` beyoncé feels this could be her big hollywood breakthrough , ' says a movie insider . ` it 's a role she has wanted for years . she 's shown that she can act in austin powers : goldmember , and held her own singing in dreamgirls , but this is her chance to prove her dramatic range and maybe even win an academy award . ' hollywood studio warner bros has been trying to remake the film for years , negotiating with potential leading men including leonardo dicaprio , tom cruise , will smith and christian bale . but now cooper , 40 , fresh from his oscar-nominated success in american sniper , has come to the fore . he will first be appearing in the west end in may with his hit broadway production of the elephant man . when that run ends , he will make his directorial debut with a star is born , and he has named beyoncé as his first choice for his leading lady . negotiations are under way to finalise the deal . scroll down for video . beyoncé was previously signed to star in a remake of the movie in 2011 when clint eastwood planned to direct the action , but the project fell apart a year later when the singer became pregnant with her daughter blue ivy . ' i was looking forward to the production and the opportunity to work with clint eastwood , ' she said after dropping out . ` for months we tried to co-ordinate our schedules to bring this remake to life , but it was just not possible . ' a source close to the singer added : ` beyoncé wants this role , and she 's going to do everything she can to make it happen , but right now it 's down to her agents and managers to hammer out a deal that works for her and the studio . ' the singer 's spokesman said : ` beyoncé is looking to get back into films and thinks she can not only take on this role but bring something special to the part . ' it has been six years since she appeared on the big screen . however , that film , obsessed , was a disappointment at the box office . beyonce will follow in the footsteps of judy garland in 1954 -lrb- left -rrb- and barbra streisand in 1976 -lrb- right -rrb- .

' i made the decision a long time ago that it would take a lot to commit to a long-term relationship or have children of my own because my pets mean the world to me . ' i had a girlfriend while i was at college and there 's no doubt that that the reptiles were a key factor in the reason we split : she hated them ! i 've been single ever since . ` occasionally there have been opportunities and nice people who have tried to flirt with me but i know they 'd never understand my reptiles , or put up with sharing the bed with a lizard .

' i also had around 17 snakes comprising of corn snakes , rat snakes , king snakes , three boa pythons , a rainbow python and a colombian python . ` are they dangerous ? yes . can they bite ? well , anything with a mouth can bite , even people , so it really does n't bother me . ' iguanas and monitor lizards are renowned for being highly territorial and for taking up a large amount of space , but this does not faze mr dixon . hands-on : mr dixon has been passionate about reptiles since he was just a child . danger : these photographs show the gory bites mr dixon has sustained from his beloved animals . he said : ` their frustrations can be taken out on the owner so of course they can be dangerous . ` they can inflict serious bites but , in my experience , bites are never given without some kind of warning . the problem is recognising the warning signs . ` what i like about reptiles is that they 're difference from your usual household pets . ' i love seeing a full repertoire of natural behaviour . an iguana head-bobbing , for example , is majestic and almost dragon-like in appearance . ' i learn new things every day . i 've seen at least 15 different communicational head-bobs from my big male iguana , albus . ' he added : ` my auntie was rescuing and rehabilitating iguanas for as long as i can remember and much of what i learned came from her . ` sometimes my big male iguana will even come up and sit on my knee and defeat the laws of his very nature . there is nothing more rewarding than that . ` and at least they never nag me to do the washing up .

' i found it so strange that i actually had to turn back and have another look to make sure i was not seeing things . the quirk in the road means cars are forced onto a narrow ` chicane-like ' bend in order to avoid the lane . ` the bus lane is so short that it is pointless and i nearly bashed the alloys on my audi when i went around the traffic islands . ' people living near to road say there have been a series of accidents which they believe have been caused by cars struggling to get through the narrow layout as they avoid the bus lane . miss taylor added : ' i understand why we need bus lanes and i think they are a good idea normally but this has to be the most pointless one in the country . following a series of accidents the lane has been branded a ` hazard ' by motorists who use it every day . ' i have shown pictures of it to my friends and they were all laughing and wondering what on earth its there for . ' another driver , who asked not to be named , said : ` there is no obvious reason why it is here . ` it 's very narrow so i assume the highways bosses think it is slowing cars down but it 's on a 30mph stretch of road here so it 's not as if motorists are driving fast along here . ' i think it 's more likely to cause accidents rather than prevent them . ` the bus drivers must find it very amusing as well . ' a thurrock council spokesman said : ` at the time the bus lane was put in -- in 2007 -- the north stifford village was suffering from hgvs using high road as a short cut to and from the nearby a13 and especially when the queen elizabeth ii bridge and m25 southbound was jammed . ` high road had and still has safety speed restricting tables across the road width and it also has a number of aging houses close to the road , this lead to residents suffering noise , dirt and major vibration problems . ` the installation of a bus gate of this type has effectively reduced hgv traffic while still allowing public transport access to and through the village . ` the council has received no complaints from villagers about this bus gate in recent years . ' thousands of drivers have to make the awkward manoeuvre despite only a handful of buses being timetabled .

' i still cook the kid 's teas and it smells and looks great but if i even had a bite then i 'd be in crippling pain . ' the mother-of-two ` miracle ' children was forced to jack in her new admin job after just three months to battle the debilitating illness . her weight plummeted from nine stone to just seven and her attempts to regain weight by eating food caused her to regurgitate anything she consumed . gastroparesis is a chronic condition in which the stomach is unable to empty in the normal way . symptoms including feeling sick and vomiting when eating , bloating , loss of appetite and weight loss . the problem is thought to be caused by a problem with the nerves or muscles controlling the emptying of the stomach . in many cases , the cause of this nerve damage is unknown but it can also be caused by poorly controlled diabetes . other possible causes include parkinson 's disease , multiple sclerosis and some medications . the condition can not be cured but it can usually be controlled . some people are able to manage the condition by changing their diet , for example by eating six small meals a day or by sticking to soft , easily digestible foods . in some cases , symptoms can be improved with medication but other people require injections of botox into the valve between their stomach and small intestine . if all of these options fail , a patient can have a new procedure which involves fitting a pacemaker device to encourage the stomach to process food . if none of these options succeed in making the stomach process food , the patient will have to be fed through a tube . source : nhs choices . the condition meant at her wedding she could only look on as guests lapped up a feast of duck , beef and a rich chocolate cake for dessert . mrs nichols said : ` imagine being sat at the top table at your wedding watching everyone tuck in to the wedding cake that you made and you ca n't have any . ` it was the same with the wedding breakfast and i just had to hold the glass of champagne for the toast , i could n't even have a sip . ` of course , it was a magical day but it was so difficult . ' mrs nichols ' problems began when she was 18 . her stomach stopped working after a bout of flu two years earlier , leaving her unable to keep any food or liquid down . she would vomit up to 50 times a day , but doctors suspected she had an eating disorder . finally , in 2008 mrs nichols was diagnosed with gastroparesis , a condition in which there is a problem with nerves or stomach muscles , meaning it does not empty itself of food properly . it is caused by damage to the vagus nerve , which regulates the digestive system . when this nerve is damaged , the muscles in the stomach and intestines stop working , preventing food from moving through the digestive system properly . it is usually cause by diabetes , parkinson 's or as a complication of surgery , but sometimes there is no clear cause and sufferers report they after coming down with flu , a virus , food poisoning or after taking antibiotics . mrs nichols was fitted with a gastro pacemaker , a metal device fitted in the abdomen to transmit electrical signals to the stomach muscles to get them working again . but the emergency measure failed and she suffered intestinal failure , where her bowel could not digest the foods and absorb the fluids necessary for her to live . she has to be fed directly into her bloodstream with total parenteral nutrition -lrb- tpn -rrb- - a specially made three-litre bag and pump that gives her nutrients for 12 hours every night . she has a food bag two days a week and a glucose bag five days a week , which both have to be stored between two and eight degrees . mrs nichols was struck down with mild flu in 2008 , and after this vomited up to 50 times a day . she was unable to eat any of the food on her wedding day to partner ben , an it worker . a side effect of being fed through a tube is that mrs nichols ' hair became thin and fell out , something she finds difficult . mrs nichols said : ` it has a real impact on your life because you ca n't make any last-minute decisions - everything has to be planned months in advance ' ` you have to have the bag delivered there , the bag has to be stored in a fridge between two and eight degrees , everything has to be deep cleaned - sometimes it just really is n't worth it . ' ` it 's funny because it really restricts your life but , obviously , i would n't be here without it so it gives me life too . ' the illness has left mrs nichols wheelchair-bound and she has had to watch her hair fall out , something she has found very difficult . she said : ' a side effect of the tpn is that your hair can get very thin and fall out . ` my hair came out in clumps and i lost the majority of it and poor william said it scared him , which broke my heart , so ben chopped off all my long hair . ` it 's awful for a woman to have to go through that - but after he did mine , he shaved his hair off too in support . ` he joked and said he did n't want me to wake up the next day and be the only baldie in the family . ' and she was consigned to hospital for three months after becoming seriously ill with sepsis in september last year . despite the chronic illness , she has managed to give birth to son william , three , and 11-month-old daughter felicity . the two children were both born healthy despite their mother being unable to eat for two . mrs nichols said : ' i call them my two miracle babies - william was fed off my old tube and felicity was fed by tpn . mrs nichols knows she will never eat ` real food ' again , and her weight dropped from 9st to 7st . ` william knows it 's different and will always say as soon as we meet anyway `` my mummy is fed by a tube '' , which really breaks the ice . ` felicity is just coming up to the age where she keeps grabbing the tube and that 's not too helpful . ' she adds that she feels ` luckier than most ' because she was able to have children , and receives support from her family and from william 's school . she said : ` we always say that someone else is always worse off . i 'm lucky that i have two beautiful children despite my problem . my two miracles . ` william 's school is great . i have only managed to do one school run since he started in september because i was too poorly and could n't go in . ` but the staff at the nursery have been fantastic - they take photocopies of the work he does in the day and photos of him in class and they send them to me so i can keep up with what he gets up to , so even though i am not always with it , i have snippets in my mind . ` on days i feel like i ca n't take it anymore , seeing his face lit up is all i need to keep going .

' i did n't like the idea of opening up our marriage . but if i did n't do it , i felt we were heading for divorce , so i thought why not take the chance and maybe we can come out the other side ? ' his premonition was correct a ultimately the decision led to the end of their marriage and robin getting together with one of her lovers . scott says that while he understood his wife 's desire to experience sexual relationships with other people - he himself had enjoyed a promiscuous youth - he had always felt it might spell trouble for their marriage . and it seems the question of whether or not to have children had always been an issue for the couple with scott being firmly against the idea . irretrievable : after rinaldi 's year of uninhibited encounters , she was unable to rekindle her loving marriage with mansfield , and the two now have different partners . however , he defends himself in the new interview , revealing that he had always been honest with robin about his desires and intentions . ` is it cruel to not change your mind about something you believe in ? ' he said of fatherhood , ' i do n't think robin ever thought i was being cruel . at any point she could have left me and found somebody else to have a child with or i could have left her and found somebody who was n't going to bother me about it . ' during the course of the year-long experiment he revealed that he dated a handful of women , however , he only slept with one of them . account : rinaldi describes every step of the ` project ' in intimate detail in her newly-released book , the wild oats project . they had a six month relationship before he eventually called it off . and scott says it was flattering to get attention from other women . he said : ' i enjoyed the feeling of being attracted to other women and getting good feedback . i had a couple of women who said to me : ' i ca n't believe your wife would risk losing you , you 're such an awesome guy , ' so when you hear that , you know , it makes you feel pretty good . ' today he 's in a long term relationship with his girlfriend renee alexander , who he lives with and the former couple consider themselves at peace . in robin 's book she declares , ' i refuse to go to my grave with no children and only four lovers . ' but during her year of promiscuity in 2008 , she made up for lost time , sleeping with ten men and two women . appearing on itv 's this morning yesterday , robin opened up about her unorthodox decision , which she says was triggered by her husband 's vasectomy . ' i would say before the year i was in a somewhat inhibited but satisfied , normal loving relationship . ` but when i got into my early 40s my husband got a vasectomy and i knew the discussion of having a baby was over , which kick-started this experience . ' ' i looked forward to my death bed and thought . `` what will i have ? '' i wo n't have children and grandchildren . will i at least have lived fully ? '' ' ` if i could n't have one i wanted the other , ' she explained . ` like a lot of women at that age i was hitting my confidence and sexual peak and suddenly realised very dramatically that i was n't going to have children . it was the perfect storm . ' i have had lots of people telling me i should have travelled the world , tried painting classes or cooking -- but i already know how to cook ! ' ` wild oats ' : robin , 50 , negotiated an open marriage with her husband of 17 years , which allowed her to bed 12 strangers in 12 months - which ultimately broke her relationship . she also said having ` very little sexual variety ' in her youth was a motivating factor , as the fact that she was living in san francisco , which she described as ' a very liberal city ' . ' i was also at a marital crisis and was thinking about trying a partial separation , ' she said . ` so i thought ok while we do that i need to sow some wild oats and let him do the same . ' under the terms of her new deal , rinaldi took out an apartment , where she lived from monday to friday and would bed her conquests . but over the weekend she would go back to mansfield , and the two would live as a married couple , without asking what the other had been doing while they were apart . ` the ground rules were safe sex , not to get seriously involved with anyone and to refrain from mutual acquaintances , ' she explained . ` but at the end of the year , we each broke two rules . ' to find willing participants in her project robin decided not to pick up men at bars , but to be more strategic in her search . ' i was a very busy magazine editor working long hours and never in my life had i picked up a man at a bar or had a one night stand , ' she explains . so i felt like going about it in a more clear-headed , conscious way . ' robin posted an online ad , entitled good girl seeks experience . in the post , she wrote : ` i 'm a 44-year-old professional , educated , attractive woman in an open marriage , seeking single men age 35-50 to help me explore my sexuality . ' ' i said i wanted to meet in public for dinner and drinks . i explained that if it led to sex then great , but that i could n't get seriously involved or see them more than a few times . ' the next day , robin had 23 offers . so would she advise it ? ` not if you want to stay married , ' she told this morning hosts philip schofield and amanda holden . ` read my book instead and have an armchair adventure .

' the herd spent over three hours drinking , wallowing and socialising around the lodge before disappearing back into the bush . experienced guide mark lautenbach who has worked on the reserve for eight years , was on hand to photograph the amazing sight . ` elephants can drink up to 100 litres of water a day on average , ' lautenbach explained . ` with easily over 60 elephants all helping themselves to the fresh blue waters of homestead pool , they must have dank over 6,000 litres of water in one sitting . ' apparently , the elephant herds spent around three hours drinking , wallowing and socialising around the lodge before disappearing back into the bush . he said : ' i can not say it was as if they were never here . ` it looked like a thailand beach party after a full moon with piles of stinky , half-digested dung littered all over the front of the lodge and a few bucket scoops of dirty mud water at the bottom of the pool . ` the deck was splattered with mud and the grass flattened to the ground .

' however her mother told the court that on her daughter 's return to london , a psychiatric nurse said this was not the case . mrs oettinger told the inquest : ` we said donna had just come out of intensive care , paul willison had faxed his concerns through saying she needed urgent treatment . she said ` we did n't do urgent treatment here . ' in desperation the family turned to her psychiatrist , dr hemanth rao , but mrs oettinger added : ` donna said she was unhappy to have survived her suicide attempt . ' i said to dr rao about mr willison 's report ... she was recommended home treatments , there was nothing in actual fact . dr rao said he could n't help us . ' mrs oettinger had starting suffering depression after going to zaki 's father , mohammed el shaer , in egypt . trainee psychologist dr hermanth rao , said : ` potentially any patient can benefit from home treatment . ' i do n't really know how the home treatment team -lrb- htt -rrb- works in rotherham , there is a suggestion that there is some psychological treatment that they could give . ` however in tamworth road in london the htt is not experienced in providing psychiatric therapy . ` in rotherham they said the htt is necessary because of the skills of the team , but the same may not be same in london . ' i also suspect that the htt threshold in rotherham might be much lower than in london . ' dr rao said that a faxed note from rotherham social worker paul willison had not been ` uploaded ' to computer systems . in a statement the social worker told the inquest that he had advised ms oettinger was given home treatment and checked that it would be available in croydon . after seeing ms oettinger on return from yorkshire dr rao advised that she was assigned a ` care coordinator ' to be provided through the south london and maudsley nhs foundation trust . however a miscommunication meant that the intended nurse , elizabeth oduntan , was not informed , the inquest heard . ms oettinger was seen by the nurse for an assessment on december 17 , just days after her failed suicide bid . she admitted to coroner that she had not checked the notes faxed by the rotherham team . she said : ` it 's not something i would usually do , but i ca n't remember why i did n't contact rotherham . ' when asked if she agreed she should have she replied ` yes , if i had the time . ' instead the nurse said it was a ` duty crisis ' and her only objective was to make sure her patient was on the right medication . ` the immediate problem presented to me was how is she doing to be safe , ' she told the inquest . the coroner highlighted that without contacting the doctors who treated her for her overdose she would n't have been able to give the correct advice , to which the nurse agreed . shaheen rahman , representing ms oettinger 's family , said the nurse had done ` the very minimum ' considering she was assessing someone who had just tried to kill themselves . as a result ms oettinger was not immediately referred to the htt . she was admitted to a&e at the mayday hospital , croydon , on january 17 after telling her sister that she wanted to end her life . it was not until then that dr rao finally made a recommendation that the nurse be assigned as her care coordinator . but he no longer had any contact with the family after mid-january as the trainee , on a six-month rotation scheme , left the clinic . the inquest heard how ms oettinger began suffering with severe anxiety after a period of cocaine use that came to an end in spring 2012 when she went to see zaki 's egyptian father , mohammed el shaer . but going clean left her terrified she had caused herself permanent harm and , through tears , mrs oettinger said : ` donna was worried about her mental health , she had panic attacks and suffered with anxiety . ` she kept saying to me ` am i going to get better ? ' i said ` of course you are going to get better . ' in september 2012 , the family arranged to see a private psychiatrist who diagnosed an anxiety disorder , but they were told that they would have to wait up to 18 months for therapy sessions on the nhs . her mother said : ' i wanted to take her to see somebody so there could be some reassurance that she had n't damaged herself , that there were possibilities of her getting better . ' ms oettinger was left to cope with the medication and suffered with side effects , but struggled at work as her illness affected her concentration . the mother and baby were seen lying on the tracks at riddlesdown station , before their deaths . her condition deteriorated to the point she had to leave work and could not look after her son properly , the inquest heard . ` she wanted to get better . i looked after zaki , even though donna was ill she would give him a kiss in the morning and at night when he went to bed , ' her mother told the inquest . then in october 2012 she began to make threats to kill herself . her mother broke down as she gave a harrowing account of stopping her daughter throwing herself in front of a train after a trip to buy a coat for zaki . she said : ` we got to the station and she said ` i 'm going to throw myself under the next train . ' we sat down and i had my legs over her to make her sit there . zaki was in the pushchair . ' the inquest heard how ms oettinger threatened to hurt herself on two other occasions with a knife and was referred to a specialist psychologist with the south london and maudsley nhs foundation trust in october 2012 . ms oettinger and her son were struck by a service from uckfield to london bridge on march 22 , 2013 . the inquest heard a harrowing account from train driver patrick cusak who spotted her jump onto tracks with zaki as he neared the station , just yards from the home they shared with her mother in croydon . they had walked to the station from their south london home . a police report said : ` there was nothing in her demeanour to suggest they are anything other than mother and son on their way to the station ' in a statement the train driver said : ` she jumped down , i think she almost rolled over to cuddle the child . she had a gentle arm , a consoling arm around the child .

<s> david cameron should rule out a coalition and govern alone , johnson says . </s> <s> the london mayor said it would be ` fatal ' to suggest it wanted a coalition . </s> <s> mr johnson is considered cameron 's chief conservative leadership rival . </s><summ-content>the london mayor said it would be ` fatal ' for the tories to give any suggestion of a fresh power-sharing deal . david cameron should rule out coalition with any other party after the general election , according to boris johnson . the london mayor suggests it would be ` fatal ' for the conservative party to give any suggestion that it is in the market for a fresh power-sharing deal with the liberal democrats or another smaller party . ` we should say `` stuff coalition with anyone '' , ' mr johnson told the daily mail . ` we are there to win , we are there to offer leadership , we are there to be a conservative government . ` if we go into this thing issuing faint pheremonal offerings or mating signals to this or that party , it would be absolutely fatal . ' asked whether the prime minister should rule out a second coalition altogether , mr johnson replied : ` yes . otherwise people do n't know what they are voting for . ' lord steel says there is no appetite among liberal democrats for another coalition -- or among the two big parties . ' a lot of david cameron 's tories want a tory-only government , even if it 's a minority one , and similarly on the labour side , ' the former liberal leader told the bbc . ' i suspect -- if you have to look into the crystal ball -- that we 're going to get a minority government which will have a multitude of minorities in the parliament , which is something new , and they 'll be able to play one off against the other . ' he said the most that lib dems would countenance in another hung parliament would be a ` confidence and supply deal ' , where they agreed to support a larger party in key votes but did not enter a formal coalition or take ministerial jobs . he also said that his party needed to ` recharge its values ' . mr johnson , who is mr cameron 's chief leadership rival , criticised the fixed-term parliaments legislation introduced by the coalition -- suggesting it should be repealed . ` the sooner it expires , the better . i always thought it was some bit of lib dem nonsense , ' he said . ` constitutionally the thing we need to address is the rank injustice that it takes so many thousands more votes to elect a conservative rather than labour mp . it 's an absolute scandal . ' former conservative minister sir alan duncan has led the calls for a cross-party deal to repeal fixed-term legislation , branding it a ` recipe for political horse-trading and coalition manoeuvrings ' . labour 's jack straw and tory kenneth clarke support the move . critics say five years is too long , risking a ` zombie parliament ' in the final year . few appreciated the long-term impact of the constitutional change , which was introduced to ensure one of the coalition parties could not walk out on the other and prompt an election . boris johnson - considered mr cameron 's main rival for the tory leadership - said he should rule out any coalition deal after the election . it means prime ministers no longer have the power to go to the queen to ask her to call an election when opinion polls are favourable . instead , they need to win the support of a ` supermajority ' of two thirds of mps for an election to be held at any time outside of a five-year fixed period . this means the leader of a minority administration would never be able to go to the polls without the backing of his or her opponents . the only other way to trigger an election as the law stands is if a government loses a vote on a formal motion of no-confidence . but other parties then have a two-week period during which they have the opportunity to stitch together a pact to govern before an election is held . a new coalition could therefore take power without an election . critics say the legislation is a recipe for never-ending power-sharing .

' mr yousaf , the scottish minister for europe and international development , last night said mr farage 's response was ` pitiful ' and challenged him to sack mr coburn . mr yousaf is now taking legal advice following the ` islamophobic ' slur , and will subsequently consider reporting the issue to the police . scotland 's party leaders and high-profile uk politicians have joined forces to condemn mr coburn . an online petition calling for mr coburn to resign has been launched , with nearly 300 signatures as of last night . in the wake of the controversy , the snp has called on david cameron to rule out a post-election deal with ukip . mr coburn , who has insisted his remark was made ` in jest ' , made the comment during a telephone conversation with the scottish daily mail last week , in which he spoke about his appearance on bbc two show the big immigration debate . he claimed that mr yousaf was supposed to appear on the programme , and said : ` humza yousaf , or as i call him , abu hamza , did n't seem to turn up . ' challenged by the mail during the conversation , mr coburn said the remark was intended to be private . however , there had been no prior agreement that the discussion was off-the - record . hook-handed hamza was earlier this year given a life sentence by a new york judge for supporting terrorism . the hate cleric was convicted last may of multiple charges , including hostage-taking and plotting to set up a terror training camp in the us . the scottish daily mail telephoned ukip leader nigel farage yesterday to ask for his response to mr coburn 's remark . he replied : ' i really have n't read them in full , to be honest with you , i 've been busy doing other things . ' informed of what was said and told that mr yousaf has called for disciplinary action against mr coburn for making an ` islamophobic ' comment , mr farage replied : ` what , for telling a joke in poor taste ? ' he added : ` it looks to me like a joke . i have n't spoken to mr coburn at all , but i assume it 's a joke in poor taste . ' pressed if he would suspend mr coburn , he said : ` no ... come on , this is nonsense is n't it ? ` the bloke has made a joke in poor taste is my interpretation of it . i think one should make jokes in good taste , not jokes in poor taste .

' nicola sturgeon arrives at the scottish parliament with humza yousaf - described by ukip 's david coburn as abu hamza . mr farage then ended the call . ukip mep for the east midlands , roger helmer , also refused to condemn his colleague and wrote on twitter : ` david coburn makes a lighthearted remark , & the politically correct brigade go into overdrive . grow up , guys . ' last night , mr yousaf said : ` racism and islamophobia are no laughing matter . ` this is a pitiful response from mr farage - at best it shows he does n't have a clue of what 's going on in his own party and at worst it indicates he does n't see anything wrong in what mr coburn has said . ` mr coburn is not fit for public life and must be sacked by his leader . ' the snp minister said he is seeking legal advice on whether the remark may have broken laws on racial and religious hatred . terror cleric abu hamza has been deported to the us . he added : ` it has been heartening to see the opposition parties condemn mr coburn 's comments - and i have also been overwhelmed by the many messages of support and encouragement i have received from people across the country . ' first minister nicola sturgeon said the slur was ` reprehensible ' . scottish labour leader jim murphy said of the ukip mep : ` people across scotland , including even those who voted for him , will now want to see the back of him . ' ruth davidson , leader of the scottish conservatives tweeted : ` totally unacceptable . our country is better than this . and he 's got form . mindless idiot . ' scottish liberal democrat leader willie rennie called mr coburn ` an offensive fool ' while the scottish green party has called for mr coburn 's resignation . asid khan , president of glasgow central mosque , said : ` david coburn 's unacceptable islamophobia has no place in a tolerant , diverse scotland . ` muslims have spent years rightly distinguishing the true teachings of islam against the actions of terrorists . for an elected member to refer to humza yousaf as a convicted extremist is beyond the pale . david coburn 's remarks have deeply insulted the entire muslim community in scotland . ' vicki burns , of show racism the red card scotland , said : ` ukip claim that they are not a racist party , therefore they must treat the racist language and behaviour of their members seriously . ' mr coburn was also criticised by former first ministers jack mcconnell and henry mcleish . however , ukip 's scottish chairman , arthur misty thackeray , claimed his colleague had made a ` slip of the tongue ' and ` got a name wrong ' . he said : ' i very often get referred to as minty , which i believe is a character from eastenders , but i do n't take offence and run greeting to the papers about mistyphobia . ' mr coburn did not respond to a request for a comment . in an email to mr yousaf , headed sincere apology , he wrote : ` in reference to a private comment i made , reported to you by alan roden , i am very sorry that i have offended you as i clearly have . it was wrong to say what i did , even in jest , it was not something of which i am proud . ` please accept my sincere apologies for the inference , it was wrong .

' a patient this size ca n't handle any sort of sickness , ' dr nowzaradan said . ' -lsb- her -rsb- body has nothing left to give .

' despite her severe condition , laura miraculously managed to make a full recovery after spending two weeks in the hospital -- but sadly her illness was just one of her many set backs . when laura first traveled to houston to meet with dr nowzaradan , she was told that she needed to shed 50lbs from her 594lb frame before being eligible for gastric bypass . ` she is physically in one of the worst shapes i have ever seen , ' the doctor said of laura , who was a diabetic and needed an oxygen tank and a wheelchair with her at all times . after laura lost the necessary weight , dr nowzaradan proceeded with the surgery , only to find in the midst of the procedure that laura 's liver and spleen were far too large for her to actually undergo the gastric bypass . emotional trauma : when laura was a young child -lrb- l -rrb- , she did n't have a problem with her weight . she started piling on the pounds -lrb- r -rrb- after an older cousin started molesting her when she was only five-years-old . constant struggle : laura continued to put on weight , and by the time she was in high school , she weighed more than 300lbs . soulmates : joey and laura met when she was 27-years-old . he said he was attracted to heavier women at the time and liked the way she looked . instead , he had to do a gastrectomy , in which he removed 80per cent of laura 's stomach . although the procedure would n't be as beneficial to her weight loss as a gastric bypass , it was all he could do . laura , who almost cancelled the surgery the night before it was scheduled because she feared it would kill her , was devastated to learn that the doctor could n't perform the gastric bypass . weeks later she was deathly ill and fighting for her life , but battling pneumonia gave laura even more determination to lose weight once and for all . ` it made me realize how much of my life i had wasted , ' she said . ' i have taken all this pain and bitterness and all i have done was eat instead of dealing with it .

' i need to live for my babies , ' she said , adding : ' i need to live for myself . ' after her bout with pneumonia , it dawned on laura that she needed to deal with her emotional issues and began to see a therapist . ' a new body wo n't matter if i still feel the same way , ' she said . special trip : laura tried on a dress for joey . it would become the first one that she would ever purchase and wear . arts and crafts : laura was able to go out with her nieces for the first time in their lives . they spent the day painting pottery . dr nowzaradan was concerned that she had only lost 18lbs since her surgery , and noted that she was on her way to gaining weight again . but slowly , laura began to heal emotionally . she had a heart-to heart with her mom about the abuse she faced as a child and she was finally beginning to forgive those who hurt her . and it was this emotional closure that enabled her to really buckle down and lose weight . a year after she started her journey , laura lost 237lbs and could do almost everything for herself . she was even able to go shopping , purchase her first dress and go out with her nieces to paint pottery . ' i feel like i new person , ' she said of her dramatic weight loss .

' mrs behring died of breast cancer shortly afterwards . when mrs behring was informed of her son 's atrocity , she replied coldly : ` how could he do this to me ? ' mrs seierstad believes that response suggested his mother felt she may in some way be to blame . ` it was clear their relationship was dysfunctional , ' the author told grazia magazine , explaining that mrs behring had traits of an abused child herself from her own mother . breivik 's mother was a paranoid schizophrenic as was her mother , while his father was a cold and distant norwegian diplomat , offering breivik little comfort or protection . when breivik was six months old , the family moved to the embassy in london . but after another six months mrs behring had had enough of their lifestyle and returned to oslo with her baby and his half-sister . breivik 's childhood might have been specially designed to create an adult monster . deciding that she could n't handle her child seven days a week , mrs behring farmed him out to a young couple at weekends . mass killer : the 36-year-old murdered 77 people and injured more than 300 - many of them teenagers - in 2011 after detonating a bomb in oslo and carrying out a mass shooting on utoya island . ` she asked if anders could occasionally touch his weekend dad 's penis . it was important for the boy 's sexuality , ' the book says . ` he had no father figure in his life and wenche wanted the young man to assume that role ... the young couple were speechless . ' aged 13 , he took up graffiti , and briefly became part of a gang . the name he gave himself -- and which he spray-painted on every available wall -- was morg , after an executioner in a marvel comic who murders his own people . but breivik soon fell out with the rest of the gang and switched his allegiance to norway 's progress party , a more strident version of our own ukip -- anti-immigrant , anti-socialist , anti-tax . by the age of 18 he had risen to the post of deputy chairman of the oslo west youth wing . after five years , he graduated to anti-muslim websites , full of conspiracy theories about muslims taking over norway , raping and murdering scandinavian women . lives destroyed : mourners leave tributes to teenagers shot by breivik on his gun rampage on utoya island . in his blogs , he awarded himself increasingly grand titles , all of them fostering the illusion that he had friends and followers : knight commander of the knights templar , distinguished destroyer of cultural marxism , commander of the norwegian anti-communist resistance movement . he also posted tips for murdering socialists , such as acquiring a police uniform so you can move around unchallenged with weapons , and getting a job at a political youth camp . on july 22 , 2011 , he first killed eight people after setting off a bomb outside government buildings in central oslo . he then shot dead 69 teenagers attending at workers ' youth league summer camp on the island of utoya , indiscriminately shooting students at point-blank range as he trampled over corpses . it was to became the largest killing spree by a single person in history . later , awaiting trial , he was to be diagnosed with narcissistic personality disorder . breivik , a right-wing , anti-muslim extremist , was sentenced to 21 years ' imprisonment with preventive detention in 2012 . since his incarceration , breivik has made increasingly desperate attempts to receive publicity , as well as issuing a number of bizarre demands . in february , he threatened to go on hunger strike unless prison authorities cave in to a list of demands for better conditions - including giving him a playstation 3 . despite the finite prison term , he is expected to remain in jail for the rest of his life .

' pence told reporters he has been meeting with lawmakers ` around the clock ' to address concerns that the law will allow businesses to deny services to gays and lesbians . ` after much reflection and in consultation with the leadership of the general assembly , ' he told reporters during a press conference , ` i 've come to the conclusion that it would be helpful to move legislation this week that makes it clear that this law does not give businesses a right to deny services to anyone . ' scroll down for video . indiana gov. mike pence now says he wants changes to a religious-freedom law he signed just days ago , as criticism mounts from gay rights groups . protests have swirled around indianapolis since the law took effect , with activists insisting it 's a license to discriminate against gays and lesbians . white house press secretary josh earnest unleashed a biting attack on indiana lawmakers near the beginning of his briefing on tuesday . ` this piece of legislation flies in the face of the kinds of values that people all across the country strongly support , ' he said . that , earnest claimed , is why ` we 've seen the governor and other indiana officials in damage-control mode here . ' the law pence signed last week prohibits state laws that ` substantially burden ' a person 's ability to follow his or her religious beliefs . the definition of ` person ' includes religious institutions , businesses and associations . pence says the law has been ` grossly mischaracterized ' and has put indiana under a harsh glare -- resulting in a ` perception problem ' that he has to address . ' i do n't believe for a minute that it was the intent of the general assembly to create a license to discriminate , ' he said . ` it certainly was n't my intent . ' but , pence said , he ` can appreciate that that 's become the perception , not just here in indiana but all across the country . we need to confront that . ' supporters of the measure say it protects their ability to exercise their religious beliefs without shelving them when they enter the business marketplace . opponents insist it gives indiana residents and companies a legal loophole if they want to discriminate against gays and lesbians . the legal language itself does n't specifically mention gays or lesbians . but the central controversy surrounding the law concerns whether or not christians who run photography , catering or florist businesses should be allowed to refuse service to people who are planning same-sex weddings . businesses and organizations including the ncaa -- whose iconic ` final four ' basketball tournament comes to indianapolis this week -- have voiced concern over the effect of the law , and some states have barred government-funded travel to indiana . nascar , the stock-car racing circuit , joined the fray on tuesday with a statement assuring fans that ` we will not embrace nor participate in exclusion or violence . ' the organization pledged that it would welcome all fans in indiana and elsewhere . apple ceo tim cook wrote an op-ed in the washington post over the weekend opposing the indiana law and a near-identical bill pending in arkansas . at the white house , earnest said it was no surprise that ` we see business leaders saying that they are reluctant to business in a state where their customers or even their employees could be subjected to greater discrimination just because of who they love . ' white house press secretary josh earnest upbraided indiana republicans on tuesday for the religious-freedom law , which bears many similarities to a federal law signed by president bill clinton in 1993 . are you being served ? gay weddings are ground-zero for religious-freedom laws , as some vendors ' religious beliefs prohibit them from participating in same-sex ceremonies . three states have banned taxpayer-funded travel to indiana this week in response to the legislation , as well as the city of san francisco , california , and the city of seattle , washington . connecticut became the first state on monday to introduce a travel ban and was followed by washington and new york . new york governor andrew cuomo today directed all state agencies to immediately ` bar any such publicly funded travel that is not essential to the enforcement of state law or public health and safety . ' ` new york state has been , and will continue to be , a leader in ensuring that all lgbt persons enjoy full and equal civil rights . with this action , we stand by our lbgt family members , friends and colleagues to ensure that their rights are respected , ' he said in a statement . connecticut 's governor , dannel malloy , accused indiana of ` outright bigotry . ' ` the reality is , the governor is not a stupid man , but he 's done stupid things . and signing this law and , quite frankly , promoting this law , knowing exactly what it was going to do , was an incredibly stupid thing for him to do , ' said on msnbc . ` but even there , if you get the picture from who was around him when he signed this bill , there were three homophobic men standing alongside the governor . one of them who equated being gay with bestiality . that 's who he invited to the signing ceremony . he knew exactly what he was doing , and when you see a bigot you have to call him on it . ' the family research council , an evangelical group based out of washington d.c. that lobbies against abortion and same-sex marriage and promotes religious liberty , came to pence 's defense on tuesday , saying that indiana has been the target of ` bullying ' and ` misinformation . ' it said critics ' claims about the law are a ` complete falsehood . ' indiana 's religious freedom law is not ` about denying people a seat in a restaurant or a room at a hotel , ' the organization 's president , tony perkins , said in a statement . ` christians would never deny people these services but being forced to participate in a ceremony that violates religious beliefs is completely un-american and uncivil , ' he added . continuing , he said , ` we must ensure that religious business owners are not forced by the government to participate in a same-sex ceremony . ' perkins said his organization would back a clarification in the law explaining that it ` does not impact non-religious goods or services . ' best intentions : pence said tuesday that it was not ` the intent of the general assembly to create a license to discriminate , ' , and added that ` it certainly was n't my intent ' loud and proud : whether or not indiana 's new law actually makes it legal to discriminate , gay rights groups have been promoting the idea that it does . pence says the backlash has been the result of a willful twisting of the law 's meaning by its opponents . ` that 's why i think we need to focus specifically on this perception that this creates some license to discriminate , ' he said . the controversy has opened up the possibility that the pendulum indiana lawmakers pushed into motion could swing in the opposite direction . indianapolis mayor greg ballard , a republican , said monday that state legislators should add gays to the list of groups specifically protected by the state 's civil rights law . and tuesday 's edition of the indianapolis star included a special cover emblazoned with the words ` fix this now ' in giant letters , along with a scathing editorial . the newspaper 's editorial board said the uproar sparked by the law has ` done enormous harm ' to the state and potentially to its economic future . pence seemed to be sticking to his guns on monday , writing an op-ed in the wall street journal that blamed ` critics and many in the national media ' for getting their facts wrong . ` the religious freedom restoration act reflects federal law , as well as law in 30 states nationwide , ' he wrote . ' ' i abhor discrimination , ' pence insisted . ' i believe in the golden rule that you should `` do unto others as you would have them do unto you . '' if i saw a restaurant owner refuse to serve a gay couple , i would n't eat there anymore . '

despite having a coloured screen , vibrations and is monitoring heart rate constantly . and all of these features , stats and notifications can be customised on the microsoft health app that is n't tied to microsoft 's windows phone and works across android and ios as well . however , the cortana personal assistant feature is only available for people using a windows 8.1 device . through microsoft health , all of the data is stored in the cloud and can be given to doctors , physiotherapists or used for other clinical reasons . fitness functions : the band is primarily a fitness band . it features smart sensors that monitor pulse rate , measure calorie burn and track sleep quality . the device also offers workouts put together by men 's health of gold 's gym , for example , and gps route mapping so users can see where they have ran or cycled . smartwatch features : the device does n't allow people to make calls directly , but does push notifications about calls , texts and emails from a user 's smartphone to their microsoft band . it has microsoft 's cortana personal assistant built-in so people can talk to the device to ask it to take notes or set reminders , for example . appearance : the band is made of rubber and features a colour touchscreen . users can change the background screen 's colour and design on the microsoft health app . app : the band syncs with microsoft health and works with iphone , android and windows phone handsets . it additionally syncs with other health and fitness devices and services such as up by jawbone , mapmyfitness and runkeeper . sensors : it has 10 sensors that monitor everything from heart rate and sleep to uv , prompting wearers to apply sunscreen . price : $ 199 in the us and # 169.99 in the uk . availability : it is available to pre-order today and goes on general sale on 15 april . for example , the sleep tracking function can highlight if someone is suffering from sleep apnoea -

especially during the night , and when wearing it to sleep it ended up bruising my arm . however , its features more than make up for this shortcoming . the band has many of the tools seen on other trackers and smartwatches but does them much better . not only does it track heart rate constantly , which helps give a more accurate representation of calories burnt , respiration and sleep than other devices , it also gives more detailed insights into all of your activity . the band -lrb- pictured -rrb- is available for pre-order from amazon , currys pc world and microsoft store or via o2 . for example , during sleep it reveals heart rate on a graph , tells you how long you slept and how much of this was classed as so-called restful sleep . it tracks your sleep efficiency and tells you how many calories were burnt as you were dozing . and during exercise this heart rate tracker plots when you entered aerobic or an anaerobic state , tells you how many calories were burnt during each stage and reveals how long you should recover before exercising again . the guided workout section lets you pick and choose for a list of exercise routines and the band gently vibrates to tell you to move onto the next activity . this is preferable to watching a video or having audio beeps . these vibrations are also used to alert a user to facebook and twitter notifications , emails and text messages and a quick read button will show the text of these notifications word-by-word so you do n't have to scroll through on the small screen . the band was the first wearable that stopped me reaching for my phone every 10 minutes or so . the only criticism of these sensors is that the pedometer , in particular , is a little sensitive and occasionally tracked single steps when driving in a car and hitting a pot hole or going over a speed bump . microsoft claims the battery last for two days and during our tests it exceeded this . we ran a 5k on day one and walked an hour and 10 minutes on the second day , as well as received countless notifications and alerts and the phone lasted a staggering 53 hours on a single charge . this is even more impressive when you consider it is tracking heart rate constantly , and is used overnight during sleep . but the most impressive feature is the price . all of these features cost just # 169.99 in the uk and $ 199 in the us . this is almost half the price of apple 's watch and $ 50 cheaper than the moto 360 in the us and # 30 cheaper than the fitbit surge in the uk . it 's not perfect , and the price reflects the poor design , but for a first foray into this industry its a decent effort . victoria woollaston .

' andrew recommends using protein-enriched products to strengthen the hair , which add strength to the hair shaft and prevent breakage .

' mr isaacs , an aircraft fitter for 26 years , is still being treated at hospital and is unable to return to work after the accident , which he can not remember . he had been on his way home and stopped to pick up a takeaway . the next thing he recalls is waking in hospital two weeks later . biker stephen isaacs -lrb- pictured with wife susanne on his wedding day in september 2013 -rrb- was thrown over the top of blanning 's car and 60ft down the road , suffering massive pelvis injuries . surgeons had battled to save his life and he ` died ' on the operating table before being revived . he lost so much blood that he received 60 pints in 48 hours , and has had multiple operations . mr isaacs ' injuries were so severe he had to be resuscitated on the operating table in hospital , needed 60 pints of blood transfusions in 48 hours , and has been told it is very unlikely he will walk again . blanning 's car was travelling at 12mph at the time of the accident , the court heard . but a collision investigator said mr isaacs did not have enough time to react and there was nothing he could have done to prevent the 1am crash . after the hearing the victim said his main regret was not being able to be there for his father who died after falling ill in december . but mr isaacs -- who used to enjoy kayaking , hiking and skiing -- said the crash had made him a better man and paid tribute to his wife susanne , 45 , whom he married in september 2013 . he said : ` i 'm a determined person . i think i 'll do cross-country wheelchairing and world travel . this has changed me . but i would not be here without my wife . ' the first thing blanning did after the smash was phone her mother in ` desperation , fear , panic and shock ' , the court heard . she later told police the motorcyclist was going a ` bit fast ' but tests proved he was doing 32mph . blanning was jailed for 16 months after admitting causing serious injury by dangerous driving and driving with excess alcohol . she had been found to have 62 micrograms of alcohol in 100 millilitres of breath . the legal limit is 35 . judge michael roach , sentencing , said blanning 's ` stupidity ' had wrecked a life . he told her : ` nothing i can say can restore his good health . nothing i can say can restore anything he and others had to suffer through your stupidity . ' blanning 's lawyer darren burleigh read a note from his client which said : ` i ca n't begin to imagine what i put mr isaacs and his family through . it sickens me that i played a part in such a tragic accident . i can never make it up to them . i hope what happens today lifts a heavy weight off their shoulders . ' he added : ` she made a foolish decision to drive a very short distance from the pub to her friend 's house . ` for that she knows she will have to be punished . the impact will never be reflected in any sentence . ' blanning was also banned from driving for three years and must take a test before returning to the road . mr isaacs has been bed-bound at southmead hospital since the accident in may last year and today branded blanning 's sentence ` utterly and totally unsubstantial ' blanning called her mother in a panic after the accident , and initially tried to claim mr isaacs had been travelling ' a bit fast ' , but later tests showed he was going at 32mph . mr isaacs has lost his job of 26-years following the horror crash after his injuries left him unable to return to work and now has to manage his spinal pain using an inflatable mattress . sentencing blanning at bristol crown court , judge michael roach said a life had been ruined by her ` stupidity ' -lrb- pictured , scars on mr isaacs ' stomach after multiple surgeries -rrb- .

' his wife ensaf haidar said her husband is in ' a poor condition ' , adding he had suffered from high blood pressure and was mentally very stressed . badawi said a cheering crowd chanted ` allahu akbar ' during his first flogging session . pictured : leaked video footage taken on a mobile phone showed the beating in january . badawi 's remarks form the preface of a book entitled ' 1,000 lashes : why i say what i think ' , which is due to be published in germany on april 1 . der spiegel said the german government had warned against the book 's publication because it could put the blogger 's life at risk , though berlin and the publisher have denied this . a german diplomat told reuters that badawi was free to publish in germany whatever he liked , but added : ` the ministry can not predict the consequences of such a publication for him . ' publisher siv bublitz from ullstein buchverlage said that the company had ` confidential contacts ' with the german government on the badawi book project . ` at no time have we felt that the exchange was an attempt by the foreign ministry to prevent our publication or to complicate it , ' he said on friday . in another statement issued today , the publisher added badawi had dictated his remarks to his wife on the phone and that the preface therefore should not be called a letter , as described in earlier statements . the father-of-three -lrb- pictured with his children -rrb- was sentenced to 10 years in jail and weekly floggings last year . human rights groups and several western governments have called on riyadh to cancel the sentence of 1,000 lashes . germany 's economy minister and vice chancellor sigmar gabriel said during a visit to riyadh this month that he had discussed human rights issues in saudi arabia and had suggested a pardon for badawi . badawi 's floggings were paused after doctors ruled his scars had not healed sufficiently after his first beating for him to face another round , but the government has so far failed to come up with a long term solution . but earlier this month , it was revealed that he may now face the death penalty after his wife revealed the country 's criminal courts want him to face a retrial for apostasy .

' a spokesman for church said : ` he was left mortified over the situation . ` the complaint was settled , and that decision was the correct course of action . ' a representative for ms diamond confirmed that action was brought against the magazine . mr church has also been the subject of a number of legal actions involving high-profile names . the first of these lawsuits was brought by ms diamond and her then husband , tv executive mike hollingsworth , in 1991 over what they believed to be an offensive cartoon published in a magazine owned by mr church . in 1996 , he landed in hot water again when his company celebrity publications brought out boyzone 's official magazine . the pop band 's management said they planned to sue the firm when the magazine folded after one issue , leaving angry teenage fans who had paid a # 30 subscription fee out of pocket . at the time , the band 's manager , john reynolds , said : ` we are disgusted with celebrity publications and their disregard for boyzone fans . the whole matter is in the hands of our lawyers . celebrity publications were recommended to us because they also handled the official east 17 magazine . ' mr church caused more controversy when he launched a monthly ` lads ' mag ' in 2004 called sorted that offered advice on shoplifting and taking ecstasy . but this also proved to be a doomed venture and folded after four editions , owing thousands of pounds and unpaid wages to staff . despite his financial troubles , mr church is now the majority owner of a call centre that the ico says has cornered a sizeable proportion of the cold-call market . david clancy , from the information regulator , said . ` it is astounding to think that this one small company has the ability to pester millions of people with unwanted calls on a huge scale . ' the firm is based at the gemini business centre in hove and shares its address and directors with several other cold-call companies . for legal reasons , the company being investigated can not be named . the ico launched an investigation into the centre after receiving reports that its staff had been phoning people who had asked not to receive unsolicited sales or marketing calls . the watchdog suspects the firm used automatic dialling technology to make up to six million nuisance calls a day . these calls resulted in ` millions upon millions ' of anonymous messages being left on people 's home phones and mobiles with offers about debt management and ppi claims services . the ico said the company invited victims to press 9 to speak to a call handler regarding a ppi claim , or 5 to stop the calls . but investigators for the watchdog said there was evidence that those who pressed 5 continued to be harassed . mr clancy added : ' i have never seen an operation of this size . those targeted will have included the elderly or people vulnerable for other reasons . we received a vast number of complaints from hundreds of people who were frightened by these calls . ' the ico confiscated paperwork and computer equipment during its raid on march 12 and is considering what further action to take . church once took thousands of pounds in subscription fees from teenage boyzone -lrb- pictured , file photo -rrb- fans for a magazine that folded after one issue . last night , conservative mp jackie doyle-price , who is a member of the all-party parliamentary group on nuisance calls , called for firms to be ` named and shamed . ' she said : ` you will then find out who is behind them and the chances are that anyone who 's prepared to make nuisance calls is probably playing fast and loose with the law elsewhere . ` we also need to be taking action against those companies using nuisance calls to generate business . ' mr church 's lawyer , matthew higdon , insisted there had been ` no formal allegation , charge or complaint ' received by his client or any companies associated with him . he said neither mr church nor his companies had ` received any notification as to any investigation by the ico or any other regulatory authority ' . the raid comes ahead of the introduction of new powers on april 6 that will make it easier for the ico to fine rogue cold-call companies up to # 500,000 . recent figures show that 30 million britons receive up to a billion nuisance phone calls and text messages every year . the new powers due to come into force follow a sustained campaign by the ico to make it easier to fine companies found to be making nuisance calls . the ico has struggled to punish rogue firms because of the requirement to prove the business had caused ` substantial damage or distress ' . but now the regulator simply has to demonstrate a firm has been a significant nuisance to apply fines of up to # 500,000 . an ico spokesman said : ` this law change is a game-changer . the mail on sunday has exposed firms using cold calls in the past . in 2013 , our undercover investigation revealed how one company , lead performance limited , had phoned thousands of people to persuade them to release money from their pensions without warning of the risk of large losses . by michael powell . nuisance calls are being taken to new levels of absurdity by firms that telephone the public uninvited -- to offer services to stop cold calls . but what many people do not realise is that a safeguard against cold calls is already available for free through the government-backed telephone preference service -lrb- tps -rrb- . two firms offering to block cold calls have recently been placed on a monitoring list of the information commissioner 's office -lrb- ico -rrb- . the list features the 20 ` worst ' culprits based on the number of complaints and information from consumer organisations . cold call elimination 's director is leah masters -lrb- pictured -rrb- , 31 , who is pictured on facebook enjoying holidays in las vegas and marbella , . cold call elimination has been warned it is on the regulator 's radar amid allegations that staff gave the impression they were calling from bt to offer a government-backed scheme . the firm offers services priced between # 34.99 and # 129.99 that include fitting a ` call-blocker ' device to landlines to stopping unwanted calls from uk and foreign numbers . however , anyone can register for free with the tps . firms making calls without prior consent to people signed up to the tps are breaking the law . cold call elimination 's director is leah masters , 31 , who is pictured on facebook enjoying holidays in las vegas and marbella , and drinking from a bottle of champagne . the company denies any wrongdoing and says it follows all trading standards practices . it is not under investigation but is being ` monitored ' by the ico , which could order a full probe if it suspects illegal practices or non-compliance with cold-calling regulations . the firm denies its staff have alluded to being from bt or offering a government service . it says it gets numbers from companies that sell data but intends only to contact people who have ` opted in ' . nuisance call prevention service is also on the ico monitoring list . it did not respond to repeated requests for comment . double-glazing firm zenith staybrite has also been placed on the ico list . the company is owned by hi sales , whose chief executive is ian blackhurst , co-owner of premiership rugby side sale sharks . a legal spokesman for mr blackhurst denied zenith has had a ` significant number of caller complaints ' or had ` acted in breach of the relevant regulations ' . he added that mr blackhurst had no operational involvement in zenith .

' fran went on to meet her birth mother four years ago , an encounter she describes as ` overwhelming ' . however , her birth mother did not tell her about the existence of brother niall . last year , she was contacted by an adoption agency telling her they had received a letter from her older brother who wanted to get in touch . they added that he had announced his wish ` publicly ' . ` when i heard `` publicly '' , i was really confused , so myself and my partner googled `` niall '' and `` st patrick 's home '' , and up came this story about niall . i knew it had to be him . i made contact immediately and we talked for hours . ' st patrick 's mother and baby home on the navan road in dublin , where niall and fran 's mother was living with them as babies and from where they were adopted . niall when he was a baby -lrb- left -rrb- and as a toddler -lrb- right -rrb- . he was adopted by frank and lily boylan , and grew up in raheny with the couple 's biological daughter geraldine and a younger brother arthur , who was also adopted . niall 's original birth document , which registers his birth at st patrick 's home on september 21 , 1963 . she flew to meet her brother for the first time last weekend , along with her partner , and the pair went for dinner and a night out together . ` it went really well , ' said niall . ` we are both delighted . we had spoken on the phone and on facebook and then finally we met . ` she 's very like me in many ways . i could hear her personality and we are very similar . you never know how these things will go but this went really well . ' ` we were in the same crowd , we knew the same people , it 's crazy to think that , ' niall said . ` imagine if we 'd ended up going out with each other ? this is why people need to know who they are . ' his sister , who has two adult children , said : ` to meet niall after all these years is wonderful . ' both were struck by the fact that they grew up in close proximity to one another . fran , who works as an estate agent and has a son , 27 , and daughter , 22 , said : ` i was born in november 1965 , just 13 months after niall and we would have been in st patrick 's at the same time . ` we definitely overlapped , but we were never told . ' fran 's adoptive family , the kavanaghs , who she is no longer in touch with after her adopted parents died when she was a teenager , moved from glasnevin to raheny , where niall lived , in 1969 . ` so we were only down the road from each other , ' she pointed out . ` i went to tamangos nightclub and niall would have dj 'd there . we were definitely in each other 's company . ' niall is a radio presenter on irish station classic hits 4fm . it was through his high media profile that fran was easily able to track him down and contacted him through his email on the station 's website . the pair found out about each other after being sent a letter from an adoption agency . fran was given the name of her brother and began searching for him online and came across the irish dj and got in touch . she pointed out that one of niall 's best friends even dj 'd at her 21st birthday party . both niall , a father of three , and fran have met their biological mother in recent years . she gave birth to a third child , whose care she initially entrusted to her sister-in-law . she eventually married and had a fourth child , and raised her two youngest children with her husband , who was never told of the existence of niall and fran . they have considerable sympathy for their birth mother . niall said : ` i feel sorry for my mother : she 's old and does n't remember a huge amount . ` she said they -lsb- the st patrick 's home mothers -rsb- could be sent out to clean a church , and come back to find their baby gone . ` she said the mothers would slip notes into their babies ' nappies in the hope that the adoptive parents would keep them and give them to the children later . ' however , niall says he has drawn a blank in researching his birth father . ` i asked my mother , `` who is my father ? '' she was really vague , and said he worked in a church . i asked her was he a priest and she would n't say . ' fran explained that she had little interest in discovering her background until recent years . learning ` basic details ' about her early days , such as her birth weight , made her curious . ` it was , like , up until then , i was n't even born but here i was , on paper , with another life that i did n't know anything about . ` i was 46 when i met my mother , and she was 80 . she is a frail woman and i had no axe to grind with her . i was n't there to beat her up , it was just to meet her . ` i feel so sorry for those women : they were treated so badly and for her to have found us all means so much to her . fran kavanagh -lrb- right -rrb- with her 27-year-old son -lrb- centre -rrb- and her 22-year-old daughter -lrb- left -rrb- together recently . ` i 'm delighted now that i found out . i feel kind of guilty that i did n't do more before i was 46 but i just accepted the situation . i believed i was a lucky child because i had been adopted . ` but i could have met niall a lot sooner . ' the pair plan to meet up again the future and fran , who will be 50 this year , is holding her birthday party back home in dublin .

' the following day , the officer says , he was called to a meeting by a senior officer and his mentoring officer , sergeant mackintosh , who was later exposed as a prolific child abuser and who was found hanged in his home last year . the officer said : ` i was told i would break the official secrets act if i told anyone . in no uncertain terms i was told to say nothing . they knew smith was there and knew who he was .

' former apprentice and celebrity big brother star katie hopkins was not impressed with miliband either , tweeting : ` if this man is prime minister i will leave the uk . this man is not great britain . this is russell brand in a chuffing suit .

' heathcote joined the school as a part-time supply teacher in spring 2013 before taking up a full time role in september 2013 and moving into a house on school property . his flirty nature with pupils was noted by colleagues who warned him to discourage his young female admirers . he ignored the advice before swapping phone numbers with two female schoolgirls in october 2013 when they complained about struggling with exam stress . a judge said heathcote had ` fallen far short ' of his duty when he groomed the two besotted teenagers . the messages soon spread onto social media sites , including instagram and facebook , where the exchanges became sexual in nature as he begged the girls to share intimate pictures . on one occasion he even exposed himself to both girls whilst chatting to them on facetime as they sat in their nightwear . allan compton , prosecuting , said : ` police went through some of the facebook messages to one girl which did contain significant sexual content . ` the messages described fantasies about being tied up , strip tease , as well as fantasies about having a threesome . ' by january 2014 , heathcote had suggested a threesome to both girls and bombarded one with a staggering 242 text messages over a seven day period . both had admitted during the exchanges that they would have sex with him separately but refused his request of a threesome . the explicit messaging only ended when a fellow pupil reported her suspicions and police were called in . heathcote joined st helena school , chelmsford , pictured , as a part-time supply teacher in spring 2013 . heathcote was arrested and contacted both girls asking them to delete all messages in a failed bid to cover his tracks . mr compton added : ` the aggravating features of this offending include the use of grooming behaviour and the soliciting of sexual images from the girls . ` there is , within the last text , an element of cover up when he invites them to delete text messages . ` it would appear that arrangements had been put in place to escalate to full sexual activity but , thankfully , it did not . ' the court heard how heathcote had been dismissed from a previous role as a school sports coach in october 2012 following an allegation of sexual harassment from an adult female work colleague . peter barlex , mitigating , said his client had been working as a cover supervisor at the school full-time since september 2013 . he said : ` this was a situation that got out of hand . ` it is something he bitterly regrets ever getting involved in . ` this was a profession he had really set his sights upon but which has now gone . ' heathcote was jailed for five months and was made to sign onto the sex offenders register for seven years . he was also made the subject of a 10-year sexual harm prevention order banning him from unsupervised contact with under 18s without a guardian 's consent . st helena school is a secondary school in colchester , essex , with more than 1,000 pupils . a spokesman for the school said : ` mr heathcote is no longer an employee of st helena school , having been dismissed in july 2014 . ` the safety and wellbeing of students is the school 's top priority and the school followed all the correct and required procedures in its pre-employment checks . ` as soon as a safeguarding concern was raised , the school alerted the police and local authority immediately and suspended mr heathcote .

' another neighbour said : ` this is going to be a three-year project , they are going to completely gut the building and dig down , i have no idea how that 's going to be done without seriously disrupting us and affecting our day-to-day lives . ' according to the architects who designed the project , the ` double decker ' basement is required because the house is not big enough for the couple . the planned upgrade , which will apparently take three years to complete , will turn it into a ` modern family home with appropriate facilities ' , they said . the architects added : ` the proposals reflect the client 's family has grown , and the accommodation is no longer conducive to modern family living . ' ms bertarelli , 43 -lrb- right -rrb- , who won miss uk in 1998 -lrb- left -rrb- , bought the house with her husband 13 years ago for # 5.5 million . in a report considered by the council , it emerged that there had been ' a large number of objections ' from residents in the mews , who were concerned the basement may be used as recording studios . the complaints were backed by local conservative councillor rachael robathan , who said : ` the size of the extension is disproportionate . ' john walker , the wesminster city council 's operational director of development planning said in a report : ` there have been a large number of objections from other residents within the mews . ` concern has been raised by residents that the use of the basements has not been specified , and that they might be used as recording studios . ` they are concerned that the excavation of new basements is a risky construction process , with potential harm to the property and adjoining buildings .

' walker is scheduled to be in iowa for an agriculture summit on saturday that 's attracting other likely republican presidential candidates . the wisconsin executive 's well-established intentions to compete for the oval oval next year had state democrats accusing their republican colleagues of pressing the issue to help walker 's likely presidential campaign , even though walker had said he did n't want the fight as he turned his eye to national politics . they called on walker to veto the bill . ` it 's the workers in this state that are suffering through the politics of our governor 's ambitions , ' said democratic rep. cory mason of racine . vos accused democrats of having ` walker derangement syndrome , ' and said the bill was about giving workers the freedom to choose whether to pay union dues . ` i 'm not going to apologize about using the word freedom , ' said republican rep. jeremy thiesfeldt of fond du lac . ` i 'm going to use it over and over again because that 's what this is about . ' democratic rep. latonya johnson of milwaukee , and a member of afscme , said she cares about people more than freedom . ` it just angers me to know that we come here and we pass bills that affect people 's everyday lives and we do n't have a clue as to how those everyday people live or how they survive , ' johnson said . ` this bill is a bunch of crap . ' the national campaign arm of state democrats , the democratic legislative campaign committee , said in a statement that ` wisconsin republicans should be ashamed of this savage attack on unions and the hard-working men and women . ' it called on wisconsin lawmakers to put aside their ` right-wing ideology aside to promote policies that actually help the state 's middle class . ' a crowd protests outside the wisconsin senate during an extraordinary session on the right-to-work bill last week . the group much smaller than the one in 2011 against walker 's law stripping public sector unions of much of their power and 100,000 protesters camped out . still , the largest rally attracted roughly 3,000 people . ` instead of addressing the real problems facing wisconsin , ' dlcc executive director michael sargeant said , citing a $ 2.2 billion budget deficit , ` republicans decided instead to speed the passage of legislation that lowers wages , interferes with the operations of private companies , and satisfies the demands of the right-wing special interest groups that seem to have been calling the shots in scott walker 's wisconsin since he took office . ' americans for prosperity , a conservative non-profit with chapters across the country that spent $ 7 million to defend walker after the 2011 spat with unions said friday afternoon that ` every american deserves the right to work where they please without being compelled to pay dues , just as they have the right to join a union if they choose . ' ` we 're pleased that wisconsin is once again leading the way when it comes to worker freedom , ' afp chief operating officer luke hilgemann said in a statement . afp-wisconsin state director david fladeboe said in a secondary statement that his chapter is ` excited to see this commonsense legislation move the state forward and finally bring relief for workers who simply want to do their jobs . ' ` no longer will the badger state 's employees be compelled to join a labor union or surrender union dues as a condition of employment , ' he said and thanked the organization 's volunteers for writing letters to lawmakers , calling their offices and going door-to-door in support of the campaign .

' avedon made his name shooting fashion models for magazines like harper 's bazaar and vogue , but ` family affairs ' stems mainly from his work covering the 1976 presidential election for rolling stone magazine . originally planning to spotlight the campaigns of incumbent gerald ford and challenger jimmy carter , avedon soon realized he wanted to include a wider array of the era 's most influential people , perelman said . men in suits comprise nearly all his subjects , distinguished by variations in their stances and expressions : defense secretary donald rumsfeld , former california gov. ronald reagan , consumer advocate ralph nader and nfl commissioner pete rozelle , to name a few . we 're looking at you : the collection starkly depicts dozens of u.s. movers and shakers from the 1960s and '70s - including edward kennedy , ronald reagan , nelson rockefeller and george bush - in the artist 's trademark black-and-white style . rise to fame : avedon -lrb- seen in self potraits above -rrb- made his name shooting fashion models for magazines like harper 's bazaar and vogue , but ` family affairs ' stems mainly from his work covering the 1976 presidential election for rolling stone magazine . only a handful of the 12-by-15-inch framed images portray women or minorities , among them washington post publisher katharine graham and labor activist cesar chavez . rolling stone called the 69 portraits ` the family , ' though the only people with biological ties are ted kennedy and his mother , rose . visitors can also page through hard copies of the 40-year-old magazine issue , or look at a digital edition . yet the exhibit space is dominated by a wall-size display of poet allen ginsberg 's family . it 's one of four featured group portraits that avedon took between 1969 and 1971 . much smaller pictures include andy warhol and members of the factory ; the chicago 7 , who were arrested during the 1968 democratic national convention ; and the mission council , who were key players in the vietnam war . the exhibit notes avedon stood next to his camera , not behind it , when making his photos . added attraction : museum officials have set up a computer to take avedon-inspired pictures of guests against a white backdrop edged in black ; the images can be both printed and shared via social media , blending the concepts of portraits and selfie . second-time around : ` family affairs ' is based on an exhibition held last year at the israel museum in jerusalem .

' filmed interacting with the pride , kevin speaks of the special place he has in his heart for aslan , who he remembers was bitten by his father after being in the wrong place at the wrong time . the white lion is placed under anaesthetic and stretchered to the makeshift , onsite surgery by a number of people . lion whisperer kevin richardson stays by the lion for the duration of the surgery while it gets fragments of its rotten canine removed . dr adrian tordiffe operates on the lion for six hours and removes the entire root of the rotten canine . he says : ` i could n't imagine anything better than having a white lion and it was quite an incredible thing to see this really pure white ball of fluff amongst all these brown lions .

' kpmg , whose advisers include former nhs chief executive sir david nicholson , was paid to produce two of the 11 reports last year . the mail on sunday has seen the one covering staffordshire , which was leaked to a labour mp . it said nhs managers should ` investigate the feasibility ' of stripping stafford hospital of all its emergency services -- including the a&e department -- and turning it into ` an elective and rehabilitation centre ' . kpmg also recommended closing hospital beds there and in stoke , tamworth and burton to plug a potential # 217million black hole . if similar suggestions have been made for the other ten areas , nhs managers will be considering plans to close numerous a&e s and potentially thousands of hospital beds . however , nhs england has refused to publish the 11 reports , despite admitting there is ` in general a strong public interest in information being made as freely available as possible ' . a leaked copy of one of 11 secret reports recommended the closure of all emergency services at one hospital and the removal of potentially hundreds of beds . instead , it has answered a freedom of information request from the mail on sunday , which has campaigned for more than two years to save casualty departments , by arguing that releasing them now would ` prejudice the outcome ' of work to draw up five - year plans for the areas . ` for these reasons , we believe withholding the information outweighs the public interest in releasing the information . ' in the same response , nhs england admitted how much it spent . stafford hospital supporter richard duffy believed it highly likely that management consultants had recommended closures elsewhere too . ` that seems to be the remit they were given , ' he said . despite the terrible history of stafford hospital , where hundreds are thought to have died in the 2000s due to poor care , the town has rallied to save its departments from the axe . the other ten areas are : cumbria , eastern cheshire , leicestershire , northamptonshire , cambridge & peterborough , mid essex , north-east london , south-west london , east sussex , and devon . kpmg confirmed it worked on two reports . a spokeswoman added : ` any further enquiries on the recommendations should be directed to the client .

' state officials are planning to test wildlife and domestic animals around the facility to see if they have been exposed . the u.s. department of agriculture is also working on information to give animal owners , veterinarians and laboratories on what signs to look for to determine if animals have been exposed . authorities have previously said they are concerned that too few samples have been taken to decide whether livestock and domestic animals are at risk . only 39 soil samples were taken from the grounds and 13 from water - far less than the 100 recommended by previous research completed in thailand . those results showed that there was no evidence that the bacteria had spread into the surrounding area , suggesting there was no public health risk .

' i was disappointed to see yet another celebrity making an incorrect judgement about the developmental disorder . i commented to say that his statement was incorrect and that asd -lsb- autism spectrum disorder -rsb- has multiple causes of which we are still discovering many , ' daria told daily mail australia . despite the criticisms , evans has been a passionate defender of the paleo lifestyle . daria said she was surprised to see that evans was advocating the elimination of entire food groups , including grains , and posted a further question regarding how the celebrity chef came to the conclusion ` despite good scientific evidence to show their nutritional benefit , particularly in wholegrain form . ' both of her comments were deleted and she is now blocked from commenting or liking any post on the page . evans has previously released two best-selling cookbooks through publisher pan macmillan , including titles family food and healthy every day , and carr , the wife of australian idol contestant wes carr , runs the popular bubba yum yum website . pete evans , pictured with fellow paleo enthusiasts luke hines -lrb- left -rrb- , and wes carr , wife of fellow co-author charlotte carr , has been an outspoken advocate of the paleo diet . federal health minister sussan ley has allegedly been contacted regarding the issue , and publisher pan macmillan has reportedly held off on the scheduled release date of the cookbook of march 13 . the federal department of health released a statement regarding the concerns that had been brought to its attention . ` the department of health is aware of this publication and has concerns about the inadequate nutritional value of some of the recipes , in particular the infant formula , and has been consulting with experts and will continue to investigate this matter , ' the statement said . evans has previously released two best-selling cookbooks through publisher pan macmillan , including titles family food and healthy every day . a disclaimer at the back of the cookbook states that the co-authors ` in good faith ' the recipes will lead to a healthier life , ` relying on the information contained in this publication may not give you the results you desire or may cause negative health consequences .

<s> pharmacists could be stationed in gp surgeries to help treat patients . </s> <s> those with long-term conditions like asthma and diabetes could benefit . </s> <s> there is currently a shortage of gps but an oversupply of pharmacists . </s> <s> experts say the move would cut patient waiting times for appointments . </s><summ-content>pharmacists will be drafted into gp practices to help ease pressure and combat a shortage of family doctors , under plans to be unveiled today . the proposals could see pharmacists stationed in surgeries to help meet the day-to-day needs of patients with long-term conditions , including diabetes and asthma . instead of seeing a gp , those patients could be given an appointment with a pharmacist . they would also liaise with hospitals , community pharmacists and care homes to ensure patients received seamless care . experts said the move would cut the time patients have to wait for appointments , while also addressing the chronic shortage of gps at a time when there is an oversupply of pharmacists . pharmacists are to be drafted into gp practices to help ease pressure and combat a shortage of family doctors in the nhs , under new plans . many gp surgeries already work closely with pharmacists , and the proposals would see them working as part of the general team , in a similar way to practice nurses , the royal college of general practitioners -lrb- rcgp -rrb- said . maureen baker , chairwoman of the rcgp , said a ` hidden army ' of pharmacists could provide the solution to the pressures facing family doctors . she said : ` waiting times for a gp appointment are now a national talking point - and a national cause for concern , not least amongst gps themselves . ` but , even if we were to get an urgent influx of extra funding and more gps , we could not turn around the situation overnight due to the length of time it takes to train a gp . ` yet we already have a ` hidden army ' of highly trained pharmacists who could provide a solution . ` practice-based pharmacists , working as part of the clinical team , would relieve the pressure on gps and make a huge difference to patient care . ` this is n't about having a pharmacy premises within a surgery , but about making full use of the pharmacist 's clinical skills to help patients and the overstretched gp workforce . ' gp surgeries are predicted to make 370 million patient consultations this year - 70 million more than five years ago . an ageing population and an increase in those patients needing treatment for long-term and complex conditions , including diabetes and heart disease , is , in part , the cause of the mounting pressure . the rcgp said according to their research , there will be 67 million occasions when patients will have to wait a week or longer to see a gp or practice nurse this year . pharmacists train for five years , one year less than a doctor and a year more than a nurse . as such , the rcgp , which is being backed by the royal pharmaceutical society , has argued they are ideally placed to treat patients directly within gp practices . the rcgp is calling for general practice funding to be increased to 11 per cent of the nhs budget by 2017 - currently it stands at just over eight per cent . furthermore , the college is calling for 8,000 more gps in england by the end of the next parliament . david branford , chairman of the royal pharmaceutical society english board , said : ` general practice is the foundation of the nhs but it needs proper resourcing and support . experts said the move would cut the times patients have to wait for appointments , while also addressing the chronic shortage of gps at a time when there is an oversupply of pharmacists . ` having a pharmacist as part of the team can make a huge difference to both patients and clinical colleagues . ` pharmacists should be working in gp practices all over the country . it 's a win-win situation for everyone concerned . ` we must be more strategic and change the services on offer to make best use of the nhs workforce . ` patients deserve access to high quality care and services wherever they live and pharmacists are central to providing this . ' dr chaand nagpaul , gp committee chairman at the british medical association , said : ` placing more pharmacists into gp practice teams is a move the bma has been advocating for some time . ` this proposal has the potential to improve the skills mix in local gp services and raise the number of healthcare professionals on hand to provide help to patients . ` this will be a welcome step forward , given that gp practices are currently under unprecedented strain from rising patient demand and falling resources . ` the implementation of this programme will be key . for it to work properly , there will need to be additional resources to enable enough pharmacists to be placed in gp surgeries . ' a further limiting factor at present is that many gp practices are struggling because their buildings are inadequate or do n't have space to expand staffing . '

' in the guest bedroom closet of loretta 's ventnor home , detective caroline macdonald of the atlantic county prosecutor 's office discovered two large boxes wrapped in multiple plastic garbage bags . as she started to open the bags , she smelled the distinct odor of decomposition and called the medical examiner . the boxes were transported to the morgue . scroll down for video . victim : daniel burroughs was missing for six years before his remains were found at his wife 's home . graphic : the jury was shown how the dead man 's remains had been systematically taken apart . gruesome : a woman 's handbag , soaked in decomposition fluid , was found in one of the plastic totes . it contained the victim 's skull and jawbone . dr charles f siebert jr , a forensic pathologist , began opening the boxes . both were surrounded by nine layers of plastic bags in alternating directions , siebert testified . he also found dryer sheets , air fresheners , and scented beads to mask the odor of death . inside the first container , siebert testified , he found a woman 's handbag . ' i described it as olive but i did n't know the color , because it had been sitting in decomposition fluid , ' he said . inside the handbag were a ` cranium and mandible ' -- a skull and jawbone . the second , larger plastic container contained more bones , including the left upper arm and lower legs . siebert testified that he saw cut marks on the ribs that were consistent with stab wounds . he determined that the person had died by homicide . dr stuart alexander , a forensic odontologist , or dentist , from cranbury , nj , testified that he positively identified the remains in the plastic tote as being daniel burroughs . alexander compared burroughs ' dental records to the teeth in the skull . donna fontana , a forensic anthropologist with the new jersey state police , testified about the condition of the bones in the boxes . ` there was no gnawing from animals and no bleaching of the bones , ' she said . ` that means the bones were in a protected environment , with no sun exposure , and not exposed to the environment where they were attacked by animals . ' fontana then used a replica of a human skeleton and photographs to explain to the jury what had happened to the bones . she said the right tibia , which is the large bone of the lower leg , had been cut with a knife and a saw . because the cut edge was the same color of the bone , she said it had been sawed at the time of death . several vertebrae were missing , and others showed signs of trauma , including ` linear cuts as if produced by a knife .

' chief assistant prosecutor seth levy argued that loretta burroughs murdered her husband , danny burroughs , for money . danny disappeared on august 3 , 2007 . a few days later , loretta told friends and family that he had left her . she said he drove off with a younger woman in a yellow hummer with florida license plates . in reality , the prosecutor said , loretta had killed him , and her gruesome plot had begun months before the murder . loretta worked at the mey house assisted living facility in egg harbor township , nj , now called somers place . in early june 2007 , she asked attorney enid hyberg , whose mother was in mey house , to draft a power of attorney . loretta told the attorney that she and her husband were selling their home , but danny was going out of town . with the power of attorney , loretta could complete the sale . hyberg drafted the document . she did not charge loretta , ` in gratitude for the attention she was paying my mother , ' hyberg testified . a power of attorney needs to be notarized . in june 2007 , loretta asked edward t. dwyer , whose mother was also in the mey house assisted living facility , if he knew anyone who could notarize it . ` she said her husband had left her , the house was sold , but the deal was n't finished because he left , ' dwyer testified . ' i agreed to help her out , ' he said . ` she was overly good and generous with my mother . ' in june 2007 , dwyer asked his sister-in-law to notarize the power of attorney . although danny burroughs was supposed to sign the document , he did not . instead , the prosecutor said , loretta signed danny 's name to it . loss : ray wantorcik had to sit through the trial but said he believed the graphic images of his brother 's remains were what had convinced jurors of his sister-in-law 's guilt . ray wantorcik , right , was finally able to hold a memorial for danny burroughs on may 10 , 2014 , almost seven years after he reported his brother missing . ` my brother won this case for himself , ' ray said . nicole didomizio , loretta 's daughter by another man , testified that her mother frequently signed danny burroughs ' name . in fact , she saw her do it between four and six times . after danny 's death , the prosecutor said , loretta used the forged document to sell their home . the profit was $ 77,101 . but the money was locked up in escrow , and danny was entitled to at least half of it . ` she ca n't get the money if she is married , ' levy , the prosecutor , said . ` but she can get it if she is divorced . ' loretta filed for divorce on february 28 , 2009 , 18 months after she killed her husband . she told her divorce attorney , daniel alsofrom of northfield , nj , that her husband had moved to florida and did not give an address . alsofrom published a notice of her divorce complaint in the press of atlantic city . loretta received half of the money when she filed for divorce , and the other half when the divorce was finalized , alsofrom testified . as a result , the prosecutor said , between the profit from the house , and selling danny 's possessions , such as his tools and his collection of remote controlled model airplanes , loretta received close to $ 100,000 . ` the defendant has gotten away with it for over eight years , with nothing left but the bones , ' levy said in his closing statement . ` the story ends with the defendant being $ 100,000 richer and danny burroughs in the defendant 's closet . ' after two hours of deliberation , the jury convicted loretta burroughs of murder and hindering her apprehension . for danny 's grieving half-brother , raymond wantorck , of glenolden , pa , the conviction was bittersweet . ` since they found my brother in may of 2013 , i was kicking and fighting that i wanted it to go trial , ' he said .

' although there 's no specific mention of the ` over ' arrangement of the toilet paper , the diagram is a solid confirmation of the correct use . and it 's not just the over-under toilet paper debate that gets homemakers agitated ; it 's the state of the entire bathroom . other key things to consider ? cleanliness . etiquette expert william hanson said as well as making sure toilet rolls sit ` over ' , other bathroom tidiness is important : ` i very much judge a house , and the house owner , by the state of their guest bathroom . ` i would question the hygiene of the person 's kitchen if the loo was n't spotless upon arrival . finally , the age-old argument about which way a toilet roll should sit in a bathroom has been resolved . ` my own facilities for guests are half bathroom , half temple . ` there 's no streaky chrome , or chipped wooden loo seats for heaven-knows what germs to fester . ` if a guest does n't come out the lavatory and comment on its condition then i feel i have failed as a host ; so many over-worry about their food , spending hours faffing with reproducing some stack , tower or jus they saw in an over-priced nouvelle cuisine joint , when really they should have spent the time having a whizz round with the harpic .

<s> musician paul gray first suspected he might have tinnitus while on a tour more than 30 years ago . </s> <s> the guitarist 's condition gradually worsened . </s> <s> he 's now helping educate music students about the dangers of loud music . </s><summ-content>playing again : paul gray says years of loud music shattered his hearing . musician paul gray first suspected he might have tinnitus while mid-way through a tour with punk band the damned more than 30 years ago . ` i was in my hotel room one night , and i 'd turned the tv off , but could still hear a high-pitched whiney sound , ' he says . ` i wondered where it was coming from , looked all around the room , opened the windows , and then figured that it might just be tinnitus . ' this was in 1981 , and back then few , if any , musicians wore earplugs when they played live . ` the yellow foam ones looked uncool and the wax ones were totally unsuitable for musicians as they cut out too much sound , ' says paul . besides , a lot of musicians -- not to mention young fans -- saw temporary hearing loss after a gig as something of a badge of honour . ` back then , it was a case of `` oh , it must have been a great gig , my ears are still ringing '' , ' says paul , who first found fame as a bass guitarist with eddie and the hot rods before going on to join the damned and then later working with former wham ! star andrew ridgeley . tinnitus affects one in ten adults to some degree , according to the british tinnitus association . many have hearing damage as a result of being exposed to loud noise , be it in industry , the armed forces or the music business . last month , the world health organisation said people should listen to music for no more than an hour a day , to prevent damage to their hearing . tinnitus can also be triggered by conditions such as meniere 's disease , or in older people it can occur as a result of age-related hearing loss . sufferers experience a constant whirring or whistling in their ears and many struggle to find an effective treatment . at first paul , now 56 , experienced ` a whine in my ears that was louder in my right ear , a bit like the sound of a jet turbine cranking up . ' it was worse after gigs , but it would come and go , until one night in 1995 while paul was on stage with captain sensible -lrb- who topped the charts with his cover of happy talk in the eighties -rrb- . ` there was this deafening screech of feedback , so loud that it physically knocked me several feet back , ' he says . ` i ran off before the next song and stuffed toilet paper in my ears , but the damage had been done . ' afterwards any sudden noise -- doors banging , car breaks , shouting -- would make him jump . back home in cardiff , paul 's doctor referred him to a specialist at the university hospital of wales ear , nose and throat department , who diagnosed ` high-frequency hearing loss ' after acoustic trauma , and advised him to limit his exposure to noise -- and to get a new career . but for paul , being a musician was more than a job . ` it was my life . so i carried on for a couple more years . ' however , the tinnitus gradually worsened . ` it was exacerbated by extraneous noises i had no control over , such as knives on plates , glasses clinking , children shouting -- and i was hugely stressed . ' tinnitus affects one in ten adults to some degree , with many suffering from hearing damage . by 1997 , paul had to admit defeat and call time on his musical career . he returned to the hospital and was prescribed maskers -- a hearing aid-type device that played a hissing noise in his ears , now more commonly known as white noise generators . ` we were trying to retrain his brain into not focusing on the tinnitus -- it was a distraction technique , ' says tim bord , a senior audiologist at the hospital , who has been treating paul since the mid-nineties . paul was supposed to wear maskers for eight hours a day for a year . ` but i could n't follow conversations or hear the television properly , because i had great big pieces of plastic in each ear , ' he says . by now , even the click of a light switch aggravated his condition . ` i pretty much became a recluse for the next few years , which contributed to my divorce , ' he says . in the late nineties paul was referred for counselling with a clinical psychologist , but this did n't work . he turned to alternative treatments , from the alexander technique -lrb- a method of relaxation -rrb- to acupuncture . at one stage he tried ` laser pen therapy ' -- shining a torch into your ear to stimulate the growth of hair cells in the inner ear , as tinnitus has been linked to damaged hair cells . ` you name it , i threw money at it , but they were all useless , ' says paul , who resorted to hiding earplugs around the house to cope with the noise when his young son jeff had friends round to play . nowadays , one of the most common treatments is cognitive behavioural therapy -- a psychotherapeutic approach that tries to get the patient to change how they think about tinnitus . while this was some help , paul concluded he was just going to have to learn to live with his condition . he carries custom-fitted maximum protection earplugs ` which keep the frequencies down and cuts external noise by about 25 decibels ' . basic sets can be bought from most music shops , while specsavers charges between # 50 and # 100 for a made-to-measure pair . paul also avoids noisy places as , like for many sufferers , background noise makes the problem worse . ` if i 'm in a pub or restaurant i always try to position myself against the wall , so i only have sound coming from one direction , ' he says . there have been some advances in treatments since paul was first diagnosed -- such as the introduction of smaller ` in-ear ' white noise generators , and devices that combine a hearing aid and sound generator in one . paul has now learned to live with his condition and is helping to educate music students about the dangers of loud music . a new treatment , neuromodulation -- an earplug-type device designed to target the specific frequencies that distress an individual -- is available privately , but is still undergoing trials . recently , researchers at the university of western australia said they 'd identified a drug that blocks ` hyperactivity ' in the area of the brain that processes sound -- although they are yet to test the effect in humans . meanwhile , paul is helping to educate music students about the dangers of loud music . ` we run a scheme called the musician 's hearing passport , which gives comprehensive tests and advice on hearing protection by an audiologist , ' he says . ` often when i ask students to raise their hands if their ears have ever rung , eight out of ten will put their hands up . these kids are 18 , 19 years old , and do n't realise the damage that 's already been done . ` there 's still the attitude that i had , that noise is fun and that `` if it 's too loud , you 're too old '' . ' paul , who has recorded a new album , a postcard from britain , with his old bandmate captain sensible , is able to play again for up to an hour at a time , so long as he wears his earplugs . he says his father had always warned him being in a rock band would ` make me go deaf ' but he had ignored him . ` if i knew then how my life was going to be affected by noise damage -- i 'm pretty deaf now -- i would definitely have taken steps to protect myself . after all , a musician needs ears ... they 're pretty vital tools of the trade .

' the demand for more space comes despite the dramatic fall in the californian prison population . low-level drug offenders and thieves are being released because of new legislation introduced last year - meaning more cells are being made available . condemned men are held in san quentin in california 's bay area , which has a capacity of 715 , while the 20 women awaiting execution are housed at the central california women 's facility near chowchilla . update : the state 's new and execution chamber in san quentin was opened in 2010 , but it is yet to host an execution following a string of legal decisions . the men are housed separately to the general population , but would have been overflowing if a 25-cell psychiatric ward for death row inmates had n't been added last summer . a budget proposal seen by the times predicts 20 new death row inmates arrive every year . the funding would go towards the revamping of a block inside the main prison - beefing up security and updating the showers so inmates can be cuffed while they wash . the last person to be executed in california was frail 76-year-old clarence ray allen in january 2006 . he was legally blind , used a wheelchair and suffered from diabetes and chronic heart disease , had been sentenced to death for ordering the murders of three people in 1980 while serving a life sentence for murder in california 's folsom prison . two guards assisted a frail allen , wearing an indian headband , from a wheelchair into san quentin 's cramped death chamber and he was gently scooted onto the gurney where he would die . in september 2010 , a judge ruled that albert greenwood brown 's execution would go ahead . but his death has since been delayed because of the state 's falling supply of sodium thiopental .

<s> john maynard keynes ' radical ideas helped end the great depression . </s> <s> he was an active and unapologetic homosexual in his younger years . </s> <s> but keynes later went on to marry russian ballerina , lydia lopokova . </s><summ-content>universal man : the seven lives of john maynard keynes . by richard davenport-hines . -lrb- william collins # 18.99 -rrb- . keynes is a great name from our past , yet a vague one . an economic guru between the wars whose radical ideas helped to end the great depression and who then fought the americans for us in the harsh , ungrateful bargaining after the end of world war ii about who should pay for it . keynes -lrb- right -rrb- with his russian ballerina wife , lydia lopokova -lrb- left -rrb- . no one but economists read keynes ' books and the controversies they created -- because nobody but economists can bear to read about such ` a technical and difficult subject ' , as he called it himself . daringly but sensibly , this renowned biographer , davenport-hines , has studied keynes from seven points of view -- not one of them as an economist . there is so much more left to say about him with this left out . he was a man who simply simmered with alpha qualities , and could have done just about anything . he settled for being a great economist , a pillar of cambridge university , a distinguished higher civil servant , a successful market speculator , a popular writer and journalist , a dealer in modern art who helped to restock the national gallery , a theatre impresario who provided cambridge with its arts theatre , a restorer of covent garden opera house to ballet from a wartime dance hall . oh , and he farmed on his estate in sussex . presiding over his versatility was keynes ' amazing mind . to quote no lesser an authority than bertrand russell : ` keynes ' intellect was the sharpest and clearest i have ever known . annihilating argument darted out of him with the swiftness of an adder 's tongue . ' for recreation away from all this cerebral activity , keynes was an active and unapologetic homosexual for his younger years . then he converted spectacularly to become the devoted husband of a glamorous russian ballerina . he did n't disapprove of making money , but he saw it as something to spend . money spent oiled the capitalist system ; hoarding it gummed up the works and caused recurring crises . on himself : ` i have a clever head , a weak character , an affectionate disposition and a repulsive appearance ... i am so physically repulsive that i 've no business to hurl my body on anyone else 's . ' but he did -- and some of the most surprising pages of this book are devoted to keynes the lover and sexual cruiser on the pick-up . you would not have guessed it , because the cover-up was so careful , but the cambridge of keynes ' pre-world war i years was a hotbed of sexuality of the most refined kind . a secret society called the apostles -lrb- of self-elected alpha minds -rrb- held meetings at which they prided themselves on learned papers rejecting conventional moral values . ` we are the immoralists , ' said keynes . keynes ' -lrb- pictured -rrb- radical ideas helped end the great depression and he then fought the americans at the end of world war ii about who should pay for it . returning after two years ' absence , he commented , excitedly : ` the thing has come on by leaps and bounds to the point where practically everybody in cambridge is an open and avowed sodomite ! ' the apostles were responsible for distinguishing between the higher and the lower sodomy . of the higher kind , to which they aspired , the feelings of the lovers were so intense that they precluded any physical carryings-on . keynes entered into ` love ' triangles with such bloomsbury names as lytton strachey and his brother . the spectacle of two men who both hated their appearances equally -- lytton was tall , ungainly , with a tuft of red beard , glasses and a shrill voice , matched by keynes , whom virginia woolf described as ` a gorged seal , double chin , ledge of red lip , little eyes , central , brutal , unimaginative ' -- well , it is hardly appetising . keynes ' encounters in cambridge were all discreet and confined within the colleges , but he took rooms in bloomsbury for adventurous sallies on the streets . he kept accounts of his pick-ups . there was none of the higher sodomy here . they would read : ` stable boy of park lane , swede of the national gallery , the soldier of the baths , the young american near the british museum . ' also listed were the clergyman , the baron , the irish nobleman of the whitechapel baths , the grand duke cyril of the paris baths . no names , you 'll notice . anonymity was part of the attraction of the pick-up . the other thing missing from his notes is any kind of guilt . keynes enjoyed his hazardous sex life . he compiled statistics of his encounters , which averaged about 60 a year , with obvious satisfaction , as if they were cricket scores . they came to an end when he fell seriously in love with duncan grant , the painter of the bloomsbury set who had long been the lover of lytton strachey . strachey let out a hyena scream of pain when he found out . with his brother , james , he set about demolishing keynes ' reputation . strangely enough , it was keynes ' love for duncan grant , who then had a love affair with virginia woolf 's sister , vanessa bell , that changed him in the same direction . he started paying court to lydia lopokova , who had arrived in london as a star of the diaghilev 's ballets russes . it was three years before they got together at a country house party and were swiftly married with duncan grant as best man . keynes never slept with a man again . his wife , known as loppy to his friends , proved an ideal companion -- intuitive instead of intellectual , slightly dotty , full of unexpected charm and pranks . she looked after keynes , who began showing symptoms of a weak heart . although keynes was an active and unapologetic homosexual during his younger years , he never slept with a man again after he married ballerina , lydia lopokova . he overworked at the treasury throughout world war ii , but his great contributions were still to come as it ended . the first problem was the chaos of world trade now that it was dominated completely by a reinvigorated america . this was averted by setting up the bretton woods trade agreement , a world bank and an international monetary fund -- all keynes ' ideas . it took the americans some little time to appreciate that , in keynes , they were not dealing with another english grandee , like his fellow negotiator lord halifax , but with the fastest brain in the west . keynes knew that britain was broke , having sold our assets and cleaned out our reserves to survive the war . the welfare plans of the attlee government were at stake if the u.s. did n't provide the finance . there was no american inclination to go easy on their ally , who had held the fort against hitler . they still saw britain as the hated imperial power they had rebelled against in 1776 . so no cancellation of our debts was forthcoming . at last , the loan that keynes was working for would be granted -- but at interest of 2 per cent for the rest of the century , which is what it took us to pay it off . worn out by meetings and speeches , keynes limped home to england with loppy on the queen mary , only to die in her arms at their country house a few weeks later . his last services to his country were made . seven views of a man do not always add up neatly . much as one must admire keynes , there lingers a suspicion that he was , with reason , very arrogant and impatient with inferiors , never really at home either with his club men in whitehall or disreputable bloomsbury circle . nevertheless , a rewarding and fascinating book .
<s> diving trips from the tiny village of pylos start at $ 60 per person . </s> <s> highlights include sunken world war ii wrecks and tropical fish . </s> <s> the bay of navarino has 89 wrecks in total , including ancient spartan . </s><summ-content>the wreck lay a few metres from the beach . hidden away in a small rocky cove , the greek merchantman sat , broken-backed , on the seabed where italian bombs had deposited it more than 70 years before . i 'd been apprehensive , not liking the idea of scuba-diving with skeletons . ` no , no ' , yannis , my deeply-tanned curly-haired guide had insisted . ` there 's nothing more down there than nuts and bolts and the odd bit of rotted cargo . ' as i was about to discover , there was far more down there than that . spectacular : the bright blue waters of the messinia coastline hide a spectacular underwater world . i had arrived a few days earlier , touching down at messinia 's kalamata airport after a particularly grim 5am red-eye from gatwick . i 'd stumbled out of the typically tiny airport to be confronted by a flat concrete car park blotted with bollards and a whiff of hot tar and thyme . back in greece for the first time in years , i was headed for a place called costa navarino , a tiny clump of hotels perched on a round bay that had , over the years , been fought over by the spartans , persians , turks , british and latterly , the italians . but while this might have been the stomping ground of spartans leonidas , helen , latterly of troy , and menelaus , there was very little that was spartan about it . i was staying at the westin , one two hotels at costa navarino , a pretty spot that sprawls across 346 acres of scrub and thyme dotted land that , along with a seashell-shaped beach , also includes a golf course and an on-site olive grove . it 's not cheap but neither are the rooms : mine boasted a large private pool , trails of shocking pink bougainvillea and a bedroom the size of the average london flat . wonderful : travelmail explored one of the 89 wrecks littering the seabed in the bay of navarino . luxe : the westin hotel at costa navarino proved the perfect base for an undersea adventure . private : each suite has a private pool and stunning sea views . tempting though spending most of my time ensconced beside the pool was -- and believe me , that 's what most do -- i had a date with a diving instructor to attend . greece , although much-loved as a sun-dappled family holiday destination , is n't known for its diving . in reality , there 's plenty to see beneath the grecian waves , whether shoals of tropical fish or the wrecked seabed remains of the many cultures and peoples who have passed through . navarino bay , a scallop-shaped stretch of gleaming cobalt water freckled with azure patches of coral is no exception . the bay has been the site of several naval battles , the first in 426bc when an athenian fleet destroyed a defending spartan fleet in a bloody encounter . more recently , a combined fleet of british , russian and french ships joined forces to defeat a turkish-egyptian war group in the bay during the greek war of independence . later , during the second world war , navarino bay was the site of italian attacks on greek shipping -- among them the ship i was about to see , 30ft below the waves of the bay . one of 89 wrecks that litter the sea bed , the greek merchantman was the victim of an italian bombing strike , albeit a spectacularly cack-handed one . having managed to miss the ship on its first run and instead destroying a rocky outcrop , the rubble of which can still be seen , the bomber was forced to circle around -- providing the greek crew with ample time to jump ship . timeless : away from the beach , the landscape looks much the same as it did during spartan times . wildlife : as well as wrecks and tropical fish , the clear waters are famous for sea turtles . the second run hit the target , breaking the ship 's back and consigning it to a watery grave . the fishermen who risked their lives to save the sailors returned to navarino bay 's main harbour of pylos to a heroes ' welcome . today , the men of pylos , a picturesque little village set around a honey-stone square dotted with cafes , are largely employed in the tourist trade -- including as dive masters . one such was yannis , a genial six-footer with curly hair and a penchant for cigarettes who ferried us out into navarino bay . the ship we were heading for was tucked away in a quiet cove , a scalloped spot surrounded by asperous rocks blotched with lichen set above a small stretch of bright white sand . it was from there that we headed into the sea -- no backwards roll off the side of the boat here -- and plunged into an underwater world of trailing seaweed and fish in every shade from delicate blush pink to bright nasturtium yellow . then the wreck itself hoved into view , dappled with sunshine from above and rusting gently in its watery grave . salt encrustations thickened its rails and bows , while brightly coloured fish dipped in and out of its portholes . broken-backed , it sat in two pieces with debris scattered around the seabed around it . a compass . a coil of rope . a mysterious collection of cans , burst open with their contents gone . all the essentials , in short , for life aboard ship . stunning : navarino bay is dotted with beaches , including the scallop-shaped voidokilia beach . further out , the debris gave way to rocks and fish and as the land sloped away , to delicate shells and vast grassy stretches of seaweed . small clumps of coral littered the seabed , as did chunks of rock gouged by the sea from the sloping cliffs of the cove . a starfish . a purple conch . a school of transparent , tiny fish . it was n't the vivid world of the caribbean or the red sea but it was beautiful : a shimmering symphony of azure , palest pink and lemon yellow . back on the boat , we took a detour on the way back to pylos to inspect a smattering of spartan graffiti etched onto the pink rock of another small cove -- a reminder , if ever there was one , of the long history of this spot . ancient villages and an even older landscape surround costa navarino , a harsh , barren and ultimately beautiful place pocked with olive groves that still looks very much as it would have to the spartans . diving in greece might not have the glamour of the caribbean but for beauty , history and some of the best food in the world , it 's hard to beat . and getting there takes less than four hours - even if you do have to brave early morning easyjet . ca n't say fairer than that . easyjet flies from

' cctv showing joseph arriving at the police station and undergoing further searches and tests was shown to the jury . as the footage was played , mrs lawton , 49 , left the courtroom . mr lawton said of joseph 's letter : ` what he means by that is he can see himself being a disappointment in the future . he had never been a disappointment -- he was a very high achiever , he did everything that was asked of him . father : nick lawton told an inquest that joe was a ` perfect son ' who had never disappointed the family . ` he was a perfect son and loved by everyone . he thought he 'd ruined his future and he would n't be able to reach the standards he wanted to reach . ' joseph 's family did not know of his drink-driving arrest until after his death because he was treated as an adult in custody without the need for a parent or guardian . his parents have successfully campaigned for a change in the law to see anyone aged 17 or under treated as a child in custody . the previous age limit was 16 . in a statement , the lawtons said joseph had made a ` bad decision ' to drive after the party . they added : ` we were not called when he was arrested or given the opportunity to give him the support he needed . campaign : joe 's parents nick and jane outside the high court after winning a change in the law . ` the fact that a 17-year-old is treated as an adult while in custody is an anomaly of british law . once they are charged , they are then treated as children . this simply does not make sense . for someone of any age , being held and charged in a police station is a traumatic experience . ` few 17-year-olds could make a rational judgement about contacting family or legal advice in that situation without support . perhaps most importantly of all , they are fearful of disappointing and letting down their families . we believe if the law had been different , joe would still be alive .

' to celebrate her recovery , mrs inglefield together with serena and her husband , ed , completed a half mile walk to raise money for stroke charities . her stroke has proved the catalyst for reassessing their lifestyle , and they have now given up their high-flying jobs in london and relocated to the sleepy village of ogbourne st george in wiltshire . mrs inglefield , a pr executive , said : ' i expected my son 's birth to be one of the most joyful occasions of my life . the last thing i expected was a life-threatening stroke . during pregnancy , the levels of female hormones rise , causing changes in the blood vessels and the make-up of the blood . during pregnancy the blood pressure can also rise . these changes can increase the risk of stroke . pregnant women are 13 times more likely to have a stroke than non-pregnant women of the same age . however the risk of stroke in young women is small and strokes caused by pregnancy and childbirth are rare . it has been estimated that a stroke during pregnancy affects eight out of every 100,000 women . research has shown that the risk of stroke is increased in the last three months of pregnancy and in the six weeks following birth . if you are pregnant and have existing high blood pressure or symptoms of blood vessel disease you should be closely monitored during your pregnancy . strokes that happen during pregnancy should be treated in the same way as any other stroke . the risk of another stroke occurring in future pregnancies is unknown . it is thought to be a very low risk and it is likely to depend on the exact cause of your first stroke . source : stroke association . ` my doctors tell me pregnancy-related strokes are extremely rare . they think i tore the arteries in my neck , pushing during contractions . ` it is so important to me that jamie does not in any way feel responsible for what happened . ` he and serena were my motivation for getting better again . i wanted to cuddle them and look after them , and be their mummy again . ' mrs inglefield was fit and healthy and had enjoyed a normal pregnancy with her second child , right up to his birth in march 2012 . after the labour , mrs inglefield developed a severe headache which doctors suggested was due either to constipation or an epidural leak . but 11 days after the birth , she collapsed and lost all feeling down one side . she said : ' i was rushed to hospital for a brain scan but the doctors said they could n't inject the necessary dye , because i was breast feeding . ' her condition improved and she was sent home . the following night , as she caught up with her supermarket shopping online , she collapsed once more . she said : ` like all new mums , i had fallen behind with the shopping so i was doing it online when i felt a loud click in my head . the pain was so bad i was violently sick . ' her speech was slurred , she had lost feeling down her left side , and her face and mouth were drooping . she had extreme dizziness which left her unable even to sit up straight . she had suffered a massive stroke . ' i found myself on a stroke unit - at 38 , the youngest one there - and i was totally bewildered , ' she said . ' i could n't even let myself think about jamie . it was too painful . all i wanted was to be with him . i felt guilty ; i was letting him down . ` of course the stroke unit was not suitable for new mothers . i was hormonal , still bleeding , and trying to express milk . all the other patients were elderly and it was horrendous . mrs inglefield 's stroke caused her and her husband to reassess their lifestyles . they gave up high-flying jobs in london and moved to the sleepy village of ogbourne st george in wiltshire to raise their children . two months on from her stroke , rachel was strong enough to hold her son alone for the first time . during her pregnancy , mrs inglefield suffered headaches , but doctors chalked them up to constipation or an epidural leak . ` there was one advantage - i used my breast pads to cover my eyes when i wanted to sleep ! ' ten days later , she was discharged from hospital , but was still unable to walk or use her left side . she was unable to look after herself and could not hold or feed her new baby . mrs inglefield said : ' i really worried that we would n't bond . my husband was wonderful , looking after the children . but it was n't the same . i wanted to be there for my son . ' she had physiotherapy and rehab classes and began a determined recovery . she said : ` the thought of holding jamie kept me going . i wanted to be able to hold him myself . ' her daughter , serena , was sixteen months old and ready to take her first steps - and so mother and daughter began learning to walk together . mrs inglefield said : ` she was very wobbly , just like me . we walked across the living room holding onto furniture . ` our goal was to walk together to the post box outside our home , and when we did it , it was fantastic . ' two months on from her stroke , mrs inglefield was strong enough to hold her son alone for the first time . and she and serena also completed a half-mile fundraising walk . so far the mother and daughter duo have raised more than # 30,000 for stroke charities . mrs inglefield said her husband , ed , was ` wonderful ' , but it pains her that her stroke meant she was n't able to look after her son when he was a tiny baby . but she is now able to look after her children alone . ' i ca n't return to work yet , i ca n't play sport and i get tired easily . but i know i am lucky to be alive , ' she said . she said : ' i am still on the road to recovery . i am now able to look after the children on my own , though we have an au-pair to help out and keep an eye on us all . ' i ca n't return to work yet , i ca n't play sport and i get tired very easily . but i know i am lucky to be alive . ` serena is only four years old but she understands when i 'm having a bad day , and she 'll say : `` mummy head hurt . '' ' i feel sad that i do n't remember jamie as a tiny baby at all really . i hope that he wo n't associate his birth with my stroke . i would hate for him to feel bad or guilty in any way . ` despite my fears , he and i share a very special bond . ` after all , he was my inspiration for fighting this and getting myself better . i owe my recovery to my two lovely children .

after allegedly treating a backpacker with an ` african potion ' at a backstreet thai clinic . kelly lynn miller , 36 - a former alabama stripper and prostitute - was handed a five-year sentence for mowing down truck driver donald goodwin , 56 , in 2004 . miller was released on $ 50,000 appeal bond in 2009 but fled to thailand , where she changed her name to bea , switched from blonde to brunette and threw away her u.s. passport . brazen : kelly lynn miller , a 36-year-old fugitive , was pictured topping up her lip gloss at a press conference after being hauled in front of the media following her six-year flight from justice in thailand . victim : brodie smith went to thailand with his girlfreind kara spark to attempt to kick drugs . he died after taking ibogaine at a ` clinic ' run by victor cracknell and mike picone , his mother and girlfriend said . the fugitive , who gave birth to a baby boy while on the run , was finally captured this week and faces being deported to the u.s. to serve her original five-year jail term . however daily mail online can reveal she is also linked to another fatality involving a man who died after undergoing an experimental drug treatment at an unregistered thai clinic . australian brodie smith , 33 , checked into the ibogaine thailand retreat on koh phangan island to try to kick his methamphetamine addiction . miller -- a former nanny with no formal medical training - is said to have worked there as an assistant to two american expats . victim : miller killed donald goodwin , left , when she drunkenly smashed into his tractor-trailer in alabama in 2004 . miller is pictured right in a mugshot from the time , when she was 26 . former life : pictured is the gentlemen 's club in birmingham , alabama , where miller allegedly worked before fleeing to thailand . all three have been accused of administering smith with ibogaine , a dangerous herbal hallucinogen derived from an african tree . the substance is used in tribal rituals in gabon and neighboring states where many believe it can be successfully used to cure drug addiction . however , the world health assembly warns that its psychoactive properties are highly dangerous , and users say it sends them into a dream-like psychedelic state . mr smith 's girlfriend kara spark , 26 , says he stopped breathing shortly after taking his second dose along with another drug - thought to be valium - during the $ 5,000 treatment last october . the clinic has denied giving mr smith ibogaine , saying the backpacker from mandurah , western australia , injected himself with an overdose of ` illegal narcotics ' . thailand 's ministry of health took no action over the death - but mr smith 's mother diane tucker has called on the australian government to push for a proper inquiry . she has also identified miller as bea - the glamorous female assistant to the retreat 's principal operators , mike picone and victor cracknell , both from buffalo , new york . mr cracknell is believed to be the father of miller 's baby boy , who was born two months ago on the island of samui . he told thai authorities he had no idea she was a fugitive , according to the phuketwan newspaper . miller was finally snared on the remote island of koh lanta , off the coast of thailand 's krabi province , following a tip from the u.s. embassy . drug clinic boss : victor cracknell was one of the two business partners running the ibogaine ` clinic ' where brodie smith died . smith 's mother says kelly lynn miller was the woman at the clinic who called herself ` bea ' paradise lost : miller was on the remote island of koh lanta when she was arrested by tourist police in thailand on tuesday . above , a view of the island . difference : this home in helena , alabama , is where miller lived when the fatal 2004 crash took place . thai media reported that at around 9am tuesday local time , an officer with the tourist police approached her in the parking lot of a koh lanta guesthouse and asked to see her passport . when she was unable to produce the document , the officer arrested her . the pretty fugitive was paraded in front of the press but appeared unconcerned by the media attention , casually reapplying lip-gloss as the cameras rolled . thai authorities suspect miller 's relatives in the us had been wiring money to help her make ends meet . but miller 's mother penney , 70 , told daily mail online she ` laughed ' when she read about the accusations , adding : ` there 's no money here to send her . ' unmoved : miller looked nonchalant , and rested her head in her hands as she stood flanked by police officers at a news conference in phuket , thailand . ` all my dreams now become impossible ' : kara spark , from mandurah western australia , was with her boyfriend brodie smith when he tried to ` cure ' his drug addiction with ibogaine in thailand , she said . she went on : ' i only knew she was in thailand because the u.s. marshals told me . other than that all i know is what i hear on the tv . ` she called me a few months back to say `` mom , i 'm pregnant , '' that was the first time i 'd heard from her since she left . ` had i had a chance to speak to her sooner , of course i would have told her to come back and turn herself in . ` at least i know she 's finally coming home . ' another island : ko phangan island was where the unregistered clinic operated by cracknell and picone , both from buffalo , ny , was operating when brodie smith died . a third woman there , bea , has been identified by the dead man 's mother as miller , who was on the run from alabama . miller struck and killed donald goodwin while driving drunk on interstate 459 near her home in hoover , just south of birmingham , in september 2004 . the florida truck driver had pulled over in the emergency lane and was checking his tires when miller hit his vehicle and careened into him . miller was due to go on trial in january 2007 on a charge of vehicular homicide but pleaded guilty . mission : dianne tucker , the dead man 's mother , is campaigning for a murder probe into her son 's death . she identified miller as ` bea ' , the woman at the ` clinic ' when he died . she was set to report to prison but fled alabama after making a $ 50,000 appeal bond and was officially declared a fugitive in 2010 . probation papers describe her as a former nanny who left her $ 10-an-hour job to become a ` self-employed entertainer ' making $ 4,000 a month . but daily mail online can reveal that the busty divorcee led a seedy double-life as an exotic dancer and prostitute . a law enforcement source said : ` kelly miller is a very pretty girl from a good , upper-middle class family . ` she 's not stupid . she 's entrepreneurial ; she 's a survivor . she is a very good business person with an ability to manipulate men . ` this business in thailand fits exactly with the sort of person she is . she was never going to go over there to become a barrister or a newspaper reporter . ` there 's no doubt she was working here as a prostitute . she probably carried on doing what she was good at in thailand . ' miller separated from her ex-husband brett street before her fatal dui crash . mr street committed suicide in 2007 but his father chris , 67 , insisted his death had nothing to do with miller and described her as a ` pretty , sweet girl ' . former neighbors in the quiet hoover street where she lived before vanishing overnight remember her less fondly . they told daily mail online they suspected she used her three-bedroom , $ 350,000 home as a set for porn films . business : mike picone , of buffalo , ny , was the other business partner in the ibogaine thailand clinic where brodie smith went for treatment before he died . boast : what cracknell posted on facebook about what happened at the clinic . one said : ` this is n't the sort of neighborhood where you expect to see a mercedes benz or a limo but they would be parked outside her house all weekend . ' i do n't know for sure if they were doing porn but people would turn up in all sorts of costumes . ` we would see all women coming and going in cheerleader outfits . the girls were all cute and there were a lot of blondes . ` the men would wear leather trousers and there was even one we saw wearing military fatigues - it was all very entertaining . according to her housemate she was obsessed with facial surgeries . ` she had certainly had her breasts done . they were very big - we called her jugs . ' quasi-scientific : victor cracknell posted these pictures on facebook of his ` clinic ' . it did not have a permanent location but operated from hotel rooms . the mother of an australasian who died after attending the clinic says kelly lynn miller was involved with it and cracknell was the father of her baby . bill veitch , the chief deputy district attorney who originally prosecuted miller said she would likely have only served half of her five-year jail sentence for killing mr goodwin had she gone straight to prison . with good behaviour he predicts miller will now serve the full five years - thought probably not any more . ` if she had stayed here she would have likely been out in less than three years , ' he told daily mail online . ` now she 's got a two-month-old child , honestly i think her capture is a blessing for that child that can now grow up here and a normal life . ` it really hurt donald goodwin 's family when she ran . they are just profoundly grateful to the u.s. marshals for tracking her down . ' root : ibogaine is made from this root , of a plant found on the banks of a river in nigeria . it is illegal in the united states and australia and regarded as a severe health risk for its hallucinogenic effects .
<s> on a 6-3 vote , the justices on wednesday revived peggy young 's discrimination claim against ups and sent the case back to a lower court . </s> <s> young 's dispute with ups arose in 2006 after she gave her supervisor a doctor 's note recommending that she not lift packages heavier than 20lb . </s><summ-content>the supreme court has given a former ups driver another chance to prove her claim of discrimination after the company did not offer her lighter duties while she was pregnant . on a 6-3 vote , the justices on wednesday revived peggy young 's discrimination claim against ups and sent the case back to a lower court . the case concerned employers ' responsibilities under the 37-year-old pregnancy discrimination act . atlanta-based ups maintained that it obeyed the law because it provided light-work duty only in limited situations and did not single out pregnant women . peggy young -lrb- pictured in december last year -rrb- , a virginia woman who lost her ups job because she became pregnant , speaks to reporters outside the supreme court in washington , dc . the supreme court is giving the former ups driver another chance to prove her claim of discrimination after the company did not offer her lighter duty when she was pregnant . but the company changed its policy as of january and said it now tries to accommodate pregnant workers . the justices gave young another chance to litigate whether ups should have granted her request for temporary changes in work duties - she asked not to lift heavier packages - after she became pregnant in 2006 . writing on behalf of the majority , liberal justice stephen breyer said the lower court is required to determine if the employer had ` legitimate , nondiscriminatory , nonpretextual justification ' for treating employees differently . breyer said the lower court failed to consider the effects of ups policies that covered non-pregnant workers who might have disabilities , injuries or otherwise might need accommodations , and asked , ` why , when the employer accommodated so many , could it not accommodate pregnant women as well ? ' breyer said there is a ` genuine dispute as to whether ups provided more favorable treatment to at least some employees whose situation can not reasonably be distinguished from young 's ' . the outcome reflects a ` middle ground ' that justice elena kagan suggested during arguments in early december . courts must now re-examine young 's case with a more accepting view of the discrimination claim . a federal district court judge and an appeals court had ruled in favor of ups , which was backed by business groups in the case . the two sides in the case disagreed over whether ups agreed to accommodate non-pregnant workers requesting light-duty assignments . ups and other employers facing similar suits still are able to argue their policies were legal because they were based on seniority or some other acceptable reason . the case concerned whether the package delivery company violated a federal law , the pregnancy discrimination act , by denying young 's request . young , who worked at a maryland facility , had acted on a midwife 's advice that she not be required to lift packages weighing more than 20 pounds -lrb- 9 kg -rrb- . young , now 43 , said she dealt almost exclusively with overnight letters , but ups said its drivers must be able to lift packages weighing up to 70 pounds . young left the company in 2009 . the virginia woman lost two rounds in lower courts . ups has since changed its policy , and now says it will try to accommodate pregnant workers . nine states also have adopted laws directing employers to do so . in recent months , the equal employment opportunity commission has updated guidance to employers to make clear that they should accommodate people in young 's situation . yet the u.s. postal service said it has made no change in policy and maintains the practice that ups has now abandoned . supporters of peggy young , a virginia woman who lost her ups job because she became pregnant , attend a rally outside the supreme court in dc in december . the justices found in young 's favor on wednesday .

' he was referring to a handful of youngsters to have fled the country to join isis extremists abroad . last week three teenage boys were stopped trying to enter the country at the turkish border . a high court judge banned another group of youngsters from travelling overseas amid fears they were planning to wage jihad . rather than blame ` trojan horse schools ' , at which he claimed there was ` no proof ' of radicalisation , lord prescott said of the impressionable teens : ` it was n't just jihadi john who radicalised them . ' ` if i was a young muslim watching the social injustice in gaza where 2,000 people died in a matter of weeks from israeli bombings , the displacement of millions of people in syria and the u.s. using drone missiles ... . i 'm sure i could be radicalised too . ' mr ellis , a long-standing member of the respected home affairs select committee , told mailonline : . ` we must stand up for our values and defeat extremism -- not by apologising but by challenging ideologies which seek to destroy peace and co-operation . ` john prescott should focus on that an ed miliband should immediately condone these remarks and be clear that these views can not be justified .

' one popular procedure is ` cosmetic bonding ' , in which grey fillings or chipped teeth are painted over to make them almost invisible , costing up to # 1,000 . laser whitening is increasingly being offered for about # 100 . nissit patel , of progressive dentistry in putney , south-west london , said : ` over the past five years , i have seen a huge increase in adult orthodontics , primarily for cosmetic reasons . in my practice , the business has at least doubled in the past three years .

' ` in addition to their higher plant-level costs , renewables require massive amounts of extra generating capacity to provide cover for intermittent generation when the wind does n't blow and the sun does n't shine . ' the report concludes that the costs of ` intermittent renewables ' have been ` massively understated ' . as a result , ` massively subsidiesed wind and solar capacity floods the market with near random amounts of zero marginal cost electricity . ' ` to keep the lights on , everything ends up requiring subsidies , turning what was once a profitable sector into the energy equivalent of the common agricultural policy . ' the cost of the national grid has nearly trebled as a result of connecting to remote wind farms , he says . more solar and wind means britain is having to more than double its overall capacity , because additional sources are needed when wind is n't working . without renewable energy , the uk would need 22gw of new capacity to replace old coal and nuclear stations , but as a result of renewable energy , an additional 50gw is required , the report says . the annual costs of the renewables target is a staggering # 9billion , according to the report . abandoning renewables and going back to a market system would save around # 6billion a year , or around # 214 for every household , he says . but professor catherine mitchell , professor of energy policy at the university of exeter said the report ` downplays climate change as a problem ' . she said : ` what is needed is an electricity market that is constructed to best integrate renewable energy and energy efficiency for the benefit of customers , the environment and security . ' last month , energy secretary ed davey announced # 4billion in new energy deals for wind and solar schemes . it means a guarantee for some 27 new renewable energy projects that they can sell their power at a fixed price until 2040 . the subsidised schemes include 15 onshore wind farms , five solar arrays , two offshore wind programmes and five waste conversion plants . it will be paid for by householders through their electricity bills with a subsidy added to the basic cost of electricity . a spokesman for the department of energy and climate change said : ` we are dealing with a legacy of underinvestment to safeguard people 's electricity supplies now and in the years ahead . ` the government 's electricity market reforms are designed to attract up to # 100 billion of capital investment that we will need in the sector over the next decade . by creating the world 's first low carbon electricity market , we are going green at the lowest cost , and attracting tens of billions of pounds of infrastructure investment , creating huge numbers of green jobs .

' amelia 's mother sarah was initially arrested along with her father but the court heard it soon became apparent to police she had nothing to do with her daughter 's injuries . after his arrest , the court was told how jones changed his story four times during police interviews conducted between november 2012 and july 2014 . at first , he claimed amelia had simply stopped breathing when he left her on the sofa to make a cup of tea on the saturday night . mr lewis said jones then changed his story to claim he dropped her on the floor on the friday night after tripping up on a toy penguin - because he learned from his daughter that doctors had discovered amelia had suffered a fractured skull before her death . but when doctors said the injuries must have taken place on saturday night he changed his story again , the court heard . he then claimed a teenage boy visiting the house had accidentally dropped amelia while trying to use his phone . but when the boy told police it was a lie , jones said he had ` blacked out or fainted ' while holding amelia and had fallen to the ground on saturday night . mr lewis told the jury : ` he has pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice by telling the police the teenage boy had dropped amelia . mark jones , 45 , is being tried before a jury at newport crown court -lrb- pictured -rrb- after pleading not guilty to the murder of his granddaughter amelia rose jones , who died in november 2012 . ` we submit his detailed and calculated lies show the lengths he is prepared to go to conceal the truth about amelia 's fatal injuries . ` we say consider the repeated , frequent and detailed lies he had chosen to tell about his state of health . ` we say the catastrophic injuries amelia suffered were deliberately inflicted and mark jones is guilty of her murder . ' the court heard jones , of cwmbran in south east wales , had been largely absent from his daughter sarah 's life - and only made proper contact with her when she was about 16 . in the days leading up to amelia 's death , sarah said her father had said something ` odd ' to her , the court was told . he had said : ` even though i do n't like her dad -lrb- ian -rrb- , i do not hold grudges against a baby . ' the jury was also told jones had lied at great length to try to ingratiate himself with sarah - even telling her he had cancer when he did not . ` he told her that he needed surgery and turned up at her home on crutches , ' mr lewis said . ` he asked his daughter to help him in and out of the bath and supervise him while he appeared to inject himself with medication . ' the jury heard that sarah then began receiving phone calls via a withheld number from a ` dr hughes ' - who , unbeknown to her , was actually her father putting on a different accent . mr lewis said : ` dr hughes told sarah that her father indeed had cancer and was gravely ill and had a limited future . ` this was a cruel deception . there was not even an ounce of truth in what mark jones told his daughter . he added : ` the news sarah was receiving -lsb- about his supposed cancer -rsb- must have been very distressing for her . ` she felt sorry for her father and allowed him to play an ever-increasing role in her life and the lives of her children which would prove to be a tragic mistake on her part .

' pharmaceutical firm biogen , which developed the drug , called aduncanumab , wants to recruit at least 1,000 patients for tests -lrb- picture posed by model -rrb- . the trial shows that aduncanumab significantly reduces amyloid plaque -- clumps of protein typically found in the brains of alzheimer 's patients . this plaque can lead to the death of nerve cells and loss of brain tissue , causing devastating symptoms such as memory loss and personality changes . dr eric karran , director of research at alzheimer 's research uk , says the drug could prove an effective -- and safe -- treatment . he adds : ` these are very promising early results . it will be important to see results from much larger trials before we can understand how effective this treatment may be . ' the year-long early-stage trial saw 166 patients with mild or early symptoms of alzheimer 's given either aduncanumab in varying doses , or a placebo . brain scans revealed that those patients on the strongest dose showed the most significant improvement in amyloid plaque by the end of the trial . patients were also given a number of ability tests and it was found that those on the highest dose had a ` significant slowing ' of mental decline , while those taking the placebo declined the most . the findings were unveiled at the 12th international conference on alzheimer 's and parkinson 's diseases held in the french city of nice last week .
<s> india voted to support a proposal by russia , to deny gay couples working for the un staff benefits . </s> <s> the move was defeated by 80 votes to 43 . </s><summ-content>india on wednesday joined countries like iran , saudi arabia , china and pakistan to support a proposal moved by russia denying staff benefits to gay couples at the united nations . the move was defeated as 80 votes were polled against it while 43 countries , including india , backed it . speaking against the proposal , us ambassador to the united nations samantha power said : `` we must speak plainly about what russia tried to do today ... diminish the authority of the un secretary general and export to the un its domestic hostility to lgbt -lrb- lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender -rrb- rights . '' the un extended benefits to same sex couples on the basis of laws in their home countries . -lrb- file picture -rrb- . india went with the russian proposal as it was based on its domestic laws on same sex relations . the un extended benefits to same sex couples on the basis of laws in their home countries . but last year , secretary general ban ki-moon had moved a proposal to extend the benefit to all gay couples irrespective of their domestic laws . the russian envoy at the un had strongly advocated in favour of extending the domestic laws to respect cultural differences of the members of the world body . this is also perhaps the reason for india to back the russian proposal . while pakistan and saudi arabia were the other countries on india 's side , 37 members abstained and 34 did not vote at all . india 's own legal provision on the issue has been subject of much debate . section 377 of the indian penal code was struck down in 2009 only to be revived by the supreme court last year . there is one last chance for the gay community to get homosexual acts decriminalised by the supreme court . after their review petition against the judgment which made gay sex a crime punishable with life was dismissed on january 28 , 2014 , the activists filed a curative petition before the apex court on april 3 , 2014 which it has decided to hear in an open court . the apex court said the government 's indecision and flip-flop on the issue was to be squarely blamed for the situation . the bench , which ruled that making or changing of a law was the sole prerogative of parliament , questioned why the government had not acted even 13 years after a law commission report sought deletion of the section and there were repeated demands . the court said this proved that the centre wanted the section to remain in the statute .

but once she arrived , she did n't regret it for a moment . the journey was long , and not direct , and if i 'm honest , a little bit painful at times but we miraculously managed to avoid full on meltdowns and a long weekend stopover in new york was lots of fun . before we knew it , we were disembarking in liberia , off to the papagayo peninsula on the northern pacific coast of costa rica . having travelled through the country on rickety buses with backpacks for several weeks on our honeymoon a few years before , this trip was to be all about comfort , ease and relaxation . any relatively new , tired parents will know that once you 've packed the seven thousand items you now seem to need at all times , and faced the joys of a long flight , you may not have the mental or physical capacity for much else . even though children are well catered for and welcome , the resort really prides itself on peace and tranquillity . the andaz peninsula resort seemed to know exactly what we needed . good food -lrb- and lots of it -rrb- , cocktails , beautiful spa facilities and incredible views were all on tap - and despite the fact children are brilliantly catered for and more than welcome , the resort really prides itself on peace and tranquillity . costa rica 's ` pura vida ' catchphrase resonates throughout the andaz experience -

a hybrid of ` take it easy ' , ` hakuna matata ' , and ` do n't worry , be happy ' nothing is too much trouble at andaz nothing is stressful , nothing is formal . the staff are miles ahead of other places we 've visited in their genuine friendliness , desire to help and can-do attitudes . my toddler , not a fan of sitting still at a breakfast table for more than three or four seconds , was totally indulged as she went wobbling from buffet station to waiter to other guest tables . we actually managed to drink entire hot cups of coffee while watching her wander around - and as any parents of young children will know , that is a privilege not to be sniffed at . this may sound like terrible parenting , but she really was actively encouraged to play and genuinely seemed to disturb no one . it took all the stress out of ` eating out ' that we routinely avoid at home by , well , just staying in . having travelled through the country on rickety buses with backpacks for several weeks on our honeymoon a few years before , this trip was to be all about comfort , ease and relaxation . the resort boasts good food -lrb- and lots of it -rrb- , cocktails , beautiful spa facilities and incredible views on tap . we spend our days between the kids pool which is of course necessary if you want to avoid a heart attack every few minutes , and the beautiful beach . there 's much frivolity and splashing around while my husband assumes lifeguard duties and i lie on a sunbed and relax . i do reapply suncream too many times to count , but i truly barely notice . there is also an adults only pool , obviously a necessity for those travelling sprog-free because , let 's face it - there are only so many times you can enjoy being hit in the face with an inflatable ball . in the evenings , we order from an extensive room service menu , or take advantage of babysitting facilities and visit one of the three resort restaurants . standard rooms at andaz peninsula papagayo resort start from 400 $ usd , on a room only basis , excluding taxes . we particularly enjoy the chao pescao , where small plates are served in a bar setting and the food is absolutely delicious . we end up eating so well throughout our stay that it is not only my daughter who is sporting a little pot belly upon our return . nestled among the trees with a view over the spectacular blue bay you are literally living amongst the wildlife here , with monkeys swinging through the trees . the resort 's local and celebrated architect , ronald zürcher , stayed true to the costa rican philosophy when realising his vision for the resort and the end result is that you feel like you are always in outdoors , even when you 're not . the rooms are designed with the same values in mind - they sort of ` flow ' from the outside in , with vast wall to wall and floor to ceiling windows , and beautiful balconies . we choose a suite , the huge benefit for families being that we get both a bedroom and a living room . in the evenings we are able to put the baby to bed in one room and enjoy the space and surroundings in the other without having to sit in the dark in silence . it is really worth the extra expense . importantly for parents who have n't had a real rest in months , there is a kids club open every day at the resort with a great selection of toys and games , a playhouse , and plenty of safe outside space . and perhaps most importantly for some parents who have n't had a real rest for many , many months -lrb- or years -rrb- , there is also a kids club open every day with a great selection of toys and games , a playhouse , and safe outside space . the staff are utterly charming and endlessly patient with the exhausting offspring and do a sterling job of occupying them while their parents drink jugs of sangria by the pool -lrb- this may or may not have been us -rrb- . so , what about the suncream and sand , the mosquitoes and the jet lag ? i returned home delighted to report to my friend that it was not hell at all . not even close -

<s> the dangers still exist even if smokers try and limit their child 's exposure . </s> <s> the only way to protect children is not to smoke at all , say finnish experts . </s> <s> study confirms tobacco toxins can permanently damage child health . </s> <s> comes as doctor said passive smoking should be classed as ` child abuse ' </s><summ-content>children of smokers may be up to four times more likely to develop heart disease later in life . and the dangers still exist even if smokers try and limit their child 's exposure to secondhand smoke , researchers warn . therefore , the only way to protect children is to not smoke at all , they say . the findings confirm previous research that linked tobacco smoke and toxins with a lasting effect on children 's cardiovascular health . the new research confirms tobacco smoke and toxins have a lasting effect on children 's heart health . finnish children were measured for their exposure to passive smoking and whether their carotid arteries - the blood vessels that carry oxygen-rich blood to the head , brain and face - had become narrowed or blocked due to plaque build-up in adulthood . plaque buildup is made up of fatty deposits and other cells that can build up in the walls of the arteries over time , making them thicker -lrb- and therefore harder for blood to flow -rrb- . as plaque continues to build , it can actually narrow or begin to clog arteries . this slow plaque buildup in arteries over time is a progressive disease called atherosclerosis . the study involved children whose blood samples were taken in in 1980 and 1983 as part in the cardiovascular risk in young finns study . in 2001 and 2007 , ultrasound readings of their carotid arteries were taken . then in 2014 , finnish researchers measured the participant 's childhood blood cotinine levels from samples collected and frozen in 1980 . cotinine is a biomarker of passive smoke exposure . the researchers found that 84 per cent of children from households where neither parent smoked had non-detectable cotinine levels in their samples . however , only 62 per cent of children from households where one parent smoked and 43 per cent of children from households where both parents smoked had blood samples with non-detectable cotinine levels . the dangers still exist even if smokers try and limit their child 's exposure to secondhand smoke , the researchers warn . therefore , the only way to protect children is to not smoke at all . the risk of developing carotid plaque in adulthood was almost two times -lrb- 1.7 -rrb- higher in children who had one or both parents who smoked , compared to children of non-smoking parents . and the risk was elevated even if parents tried to limit their children 's exposure , warned the study , published in the journal circulation . children whose parents smoked but did n't limit exposure had almost twice the risk - and those fiull exposed had four times the risk , the study found . study author dr costan magnussen , of the university of turku , said : ` although we can not confirm that children with a detectable blood cotinine in our study was a result of passive smoke exposure directly from their parents , we know that a child 's primary source of passive smoke exposure occurs at home . ` for parents who are trying to quit smoking , they may be able to reduce some of the potential long-term risk for their children by actively reducing their children 's exposure to secondhand smoke , by not smoking inside the home , car , or smoke well away from their children . ` however not smoking at all is by far the safest option ' . repeated exposure of children to secondhand smoke is child abuse , a leading doctor has warned . adam goldstein , a professor in family medicine , says exposure is as abusive as leaving children unattended in hot car , or drink driving . he claims he was forced to speak out after caring for ` too many children hospitalised with asthma and pneumonia , caused in large part to their repeated exposure to secondhand smoke ' . dr goldsteimn argues that purposefully and repeatedly exposing children to a something known to cause cancer in humans would strike many people as child abuse . his controversial opinion piece has been published in the latest issue of the annals of family medicine . in it , he argues that purposefully and repeatedly exposing children to a something known to cause cancer in humans would strike many people as child abuse . ` but what if the substance is secondhand smoke ? , ' he asks . dr goldstein , who is director of the tobacco intervention programs in the university of north carolina school of medicine , says the damage from smoke is ` as abusive as many other commonly accepted physical and emotional traumas of children ' . his comments come after years of caring for children who have suffered severe respiratory illness due to secondhand smoke exposure . in the opinion piece , he writes : ` scientific research over the last decade has increasingly demonstrated that exposure to secondhand smoke is not simply a nuisance ; it is deadly . ` secondhand smoke exposure causes multiple diseases in children , including asthma and pneumonia , and results in thousands of avoidable hospitalisations . ` it is a major cause of sudden infant death syndrome and may cause lung cancer and heart attacks with repeated exposure . he argues that purposefully and repeatedly exposing children to a something known to cause cancer in humans would strike many people as child abuse . ` no safe level of exposure exists . ' -lsb- therefore -rsb- , purposefully and recurrently exposing children to secondhand smoke - a known human carcinogen - despite repeated warnings , is child abuse . '

' gordon 's impassioned assertion was made during a dramatic intervention staged by dr phil last week and due to air today . weeping and wailing and at times incoherent , gordon had believed that he was to be interviewed by dr phil . gordon had told the eminent psychologist that he wanted to tell his side of the story . he has felt ` vilified ' and ` depicted as a monster ' since january 31 when bobby kristina , 22 , was found face down and unresponsive in the bath-tub at the roswell , georgia home he and bobby kristina shared . scroll down for video . breakdown : with his mother , michelle , by his side nick gordon struggles to stay coherent . troubling preview : a trailer for the interview of bobbi kristina brown 's boyfriend nick gordon by dr phil mcgraw was released sunday night . swinging from crying to flying into a rage , the disturbing 30 second video shows a very troubled young man in a lot of pain as he is questioned by dr phil . but on learning of gordon 's emotional , mental and physical state dr phil could not ` in good conscience ' go on with the interview . according to gordon 's mother , michelle , who was by her son 's side during the highly emotional intervention , ` nicholas is at a breaking point . he can not bear not being without krissy , by her side . he 's dealing with it by drinking . i 've begged him to stop . ' dr phil told gordon , who admitted to having taken xanax and to have drunk heavily prior to the meeting : ` nick , you 're out of control . you 've threatened suicide . you deserved to get some help because if you do n't , you know you 're going to wind up dead . ' he added : ` you 've got to get yourself cleaned up . you got to man up and straighten up . ' yesterday dailymail.com revealed that , barely 12 hours before the dramatic encounter with dr phil , gordon was so drunk and high he was unable to walk . the disturbing scenes captured on video showed the true extent of a deterioration described by dr phil as ` exponential . ' in the show , due to broadcast wednesday , a weeping and wailing gordon admitted that he has twice tried to kill himself and confessed : ` i 'm so sorry for everything . ' asked if he still intended to kill himself he said : ` if anything happens to krissi i will . ' he said : ` my pain is horrible . my heart hurts . i have panic attacks . ' in recent weeks gordon has twice overdosed on a mixture of xanax , alcohol and prescription sleeping pills . gordon had agreed to meet with dr phil believing that he was there to be interviewed . according to dr phil : ` he felt like he was being vilified and presented as some sort of monster . ' instead , on learning of gordon 's rapidly deteriorating mental , emotional and physical state , the eminent psychologist staged an intervention and he is now in rehab . dr phil stated : ' i do n't think he has any chance of turning this round . left to his own devices he will be dead within the week . ' gordon 's mother , michelle , was by her son 's side as he alternated between compliant and aggressive -- at one point threatening to attack camera men as they filmed . she described her son as ` at breaking point . ' she said : ` he can not take too much more of not being able to see kriss . he blames himself . he 's torn up and carrying guilt . ` he 's dealing with it by drinking . i 've begged him to stop . i 've tried to help him but he ca n't let go of the guilt . ' leaning towards gordon 's mother , dr phil said : ` you and i have one mission with one possible outcome and that 's for him to agree to go to rehab to deal with his depression , his guilt ... and to get clean and sober . ' he added : ` his life absolutely hangs in the balance . ' questions still rage regarding just what happened in the early hours of january 31st that led to bobbi kristina , 22 , ending up face down in her tub . just two days ago bobbi kristina 's aunt , leolah brown , made a series of explosive facebook posts in which she alleged that the family had ` strong evidene of foul play ' relating to gordon 's role in events . she posted : ` nick gordon is very disrespectful and inconsiderate ! especially to my family . moreover , he has done things to my niece that i never thought he had in him to do ! ' leolah made her claims in response to being invited onto dr phil 's show . tough to watch : the young man sobs and shakes at times through the trailer . in her message she wrote : ` with all due respect , nick gordon is under investigation for the attempted murder of my niece ... . we have strong evidence of foul play . ' marks were found on her face and arms , marks that gordon has explained as the result of cpr which he administered to her for 15 minutes before emergency services arrived . and speaking to dr phil , gordon insisted : ' i did everything possible in the world to protect them -lsb- whitney and bobbi kristina -rsb- . ' railing against the decision by bobbi 's father , bobby brown , to ban him from his fiancée 's bedside at atlanta 's emory hospital , gordon said : ` my name will be the first she calls . ' according to his mother , michelle , gordon can not forgive himself for his ` failure ' to revive bobbi kristina . his guilt is compounded by the eerily similar situation in which he found himself almost exactly three years earlier . ' i hate bobby brown ! ' his tears quickly turn to anger when he brings up his girlfriend 's father bobby brown , who has blocked him from seeing the 22-year-old in the hospital . ` are you drinking ? ' the emotional man 's anger only increases as dr. phil asks about nick 's sobriety . refuses to go : the 25-year-old aspiring rapper storms out when told he needs help . resigned : ultimately , gordon concedes that he needs help and leaves for a rehab facility . then , on 11 february 2012 , it was gordon who tried to resuscitate whitney when she was found unresponsive in her bath-tub just hours before she was due to attend a grammy awards party . speaking to dr phil , michelle said : ` nicholas just continually expresses how much he has failed whitney . ` he administered cpr -lsb- to whitney -rsb- and he called me when he was standing over her body . he could n't understand why he could n't revive her . he said , `` mommy why ? i could n't get the air into her lungs . '' gordon has now entered a rehab facility in atlanta . meanwhile his fiancée continues to fight for her life in a medically-induced coma . it is now six weeks since bobbi kristina -- krissi as she was known to friends - was found face down and unresponsive in the bath-tub of the home she shared with gordon in roswell , georgia . unlike whitney 's death that was ruled accidental , police are treating bobbi kristina 's near drowning and injuries allegedly sustained by the 22-year-old as a criminal investigation . while bobbi kristina fights for her life a troubling picture of her relationship with nick , of drug use and domestic turbulence in the weeks leading up to the incident , has emerged . in an interview with the sun a friend of the couple , steven stepho , claimed they were using various drugs daily including heroin , xanax , pot and heroin substitute roxicodone . sounding eerily similar to bobbi 's mother and father 's drug-dependent relationship , the friend said the pair used whatever they could get their hands on . ` bobbi and nick would spend a lot on drugs every day , it just depended on how much money they had . it was n't unusual for them to spend $ 1,000 a day on drugs . ` there were times when it got really bad - they would be completely passed out for hours , just lying there on the bed . there were times when she would be so knocked out she would burn herself with a cigarette and not even notice . she was always covered in cigarette burns . ' their relationship was also very volatile . ` when whitney died nick was left with nothing , so he knew he had to control krissi to get access to the money . she 'd do whatever he told her . ` he was very manipulative and would even use the drugs to control her . they would argue a lot and there were times when he would be violent with her and push her around . ' according to stepho : ` but krissi really loved him because he was there to fill the gap left by her mother . she was not close to her father and did not have anyone else close to her . nick knew this and took advantage of it . ' troubled relationship : a friend of the couple , steven stepho , claimed the pair were using various drugs daily including heroin , xanax , pot and heroin substitute roxicodone .

' thriving : young lennox with mother emily caines , who now feels ` totally blessed ' she said : ` there were so many times when i thought , `` i 'm never going to be a mum , ever . it 's not meant to be . '' ` after isabelle and adelaide , we asked ourselves , `` are we going to put ourselves through this again ? are we going to put ourselves through potentially another loss ? '' ` but we just had to give it another go . i just could n't give up . ' mrs caines and alastair , a 29-year-old security guard , subsequently started ivf in march and she was implanted with the embryo in april . hero : professor tim draycott holds tiny lennox shortly after his birth . crucially , her obstetrician professor tim draycott used medical techniques designed to ` trick ' her body into avoiding an early labour . at 12 weeks , he put in a cervical stitch to give her womb more support . and at 14 weeks , he started giving her extra doses of progesterone . explaining why he administered extra progesterone , he said : ` progesterone is hugely higher in pregnancy than at other times . this helps to keep the uterus muscle quiet and probably helps reduce inflammation too , so there 's nothing driving it to contract before it should . ` but we think some women do n't have enough progesterone in pregnancy , so the uterine muscle sparks off . we know that if we give this medication , it reduces the chance of early labour by about 50 per cent . ' other precautions included prescribing aspirin to help maintain a healthy placenta , as doctors believe a breakdown triggered her miscarriage of isabelle , and regular screening . and in a highly unusual move , mrs caines also spent over a month in hospital when she reached 23 weeks , so medical staff could do everything possible to stop the baby arriving early . nurses scanned her every 48 hours to monitor the baby and -- crucially -- measure if her cervix was shortening . if it was , that drastically increased the risk of contractions starting . thankfully , she did not go into labour -- and a week after being discharged , she enjoyed a baby shower party with friends at home in yeovil , somerset . she said : ` it was a huge milestone because i 'd lost both my daughters before my baby showers . ' but soon afterwards , her waters began to leak , raising the risk that lennox could contract a potentially fatal infection . as a result , prof draycott and colleagues decided it would be safer to get the baby out rather than continue to 36 weeks , which had been the target delivery date . before the birth , mrs caines was injected with steroids to boost lennox 's lungs to help him breathe independently after birth , which had been a major concern . it paid off too and he needed no help breathing from his first breathe . mr and mrs caines married on september 8th 2012 in a villa in portugal . this day was the anniversary of mrs caines ' first daughter isabella 's birth and death . five days after the birth , lennox was transferred from southmead 's specialist neonatal department to yeovil hospital , and he was discharged at three weeks . but his mother admitted : ` even now , i feel like lennox is on loan because it feels too good to be true , that he is actually here . he is now 9lb 1oz , though , and doing great . he 's got some catching up to do , but he 's even started smiling . ' she added : ` i tried to thank the professor but there were n't really the words to convey what he has done for us . ' prof draycott said he was ` no cleverer than anyone else ' , but had the good fortune to work at southmead , which has one of the safest maternity units in the country . looking back on her two earlier births , mrs caines said she could not understand how isabelle could have been legally aborted . ` isabelle was born at 23 weeks and called a miscarriage , and adelaide was born one week later and called a neonatal death -- but both my daughters looked exactly the same to me , ' she said . ` we found the term miscarriage to be offensive . but what really hurt was knowing that this country permits babies like adelaide and isabelle to be terminated . i am not opposed to late abortions on medical grounds -- if there is something seriously wrong with the baby , or if the mother 's life is at risk . ` but personally i believe that if an abortion is for social reasons -- just because you 've been lazy with contraception -- then i 'm 100 per cent sure the 24-week limit is too high . we live in an age where the technology is available to keep a baby alive who is born at 23 or 24 weeks . ` i know only too well we ca n't keep all of them alive , but we can save some . so i think it 's wrong that babies can be aborted when they reach that stage . in my opinion , the limit should be lowered to 16 weeks , because four months is long enough to make up your mind if you want to keep the baby or not . ` a baby is a baby from the moment you see a blue line on the pregnancy test . i saw adelaide and lennox when they were embryos , because they were both conceived through ivf , and to me they were already babies at that very early stage . ' survival rates among babies born in england at 24 weeks have jumped in recent decades . while only 35 per cent of those admitted to neonatal care survived in 1995 , 47 per cent did in 2006 , according to a study published in the british medical journal in 2012 . but only a quarter of those who survive birth before 24 weeks escape major health problems . emily and alastair caines fell in love in the agonising weeks after she lost her first daughter isabelle . more recent research has found higher survival rates among those born in highly specialist units like southmead . and the bmj figures are now almost a decade old -- meaning there may have been further improvements in survival rates since then . at around the time that paper was published , health secretary jeremy hunt caused consternation by saying he thought the abortion limit should be cut to 12 weeks . he let slip in an interview : ` everyone looks at the evidence and comes to a view about when they think that moment is , and my own view is that 12 weeks is the right point for it . ' his comments caused uproar among ` pro-choice ' campaigners , who labelled him a ` hard-line anti-abortionist ' , but also from doctors . they said that there was no evidence for halving the time limit and that many abortions were carried out after 12 weeks for sound medical reasons . however , other senior conservatives have also backed lowering the limit , with home secretary theresa may suggesting 20 weeks , and former culture secretary maria miller saying it is ` common sense ' because ` the science has moved on ' . almost 16,000 abortions in england and wales -- nearly a tenth of the annual total -- are performed after 12 weeks . of those , 2,500 are carried out after 20 weeks but before 24 weeks . mrs caines said her newborn son bore such a strong resemblance to adelaide at birth that she felt he had brought part of her with him . ` my heart will always be broken for adelaide and isabelle , but lenny has helped me to heal , ' she said . ` we feel totally blessed now , because we know that there are so many people who will never be in our shoes . we know how lucky we are .

' he said doctors are now also appealing for donors to enable more men to have the operation . just five weeks after the transplant was carried out by surgeons from stellenbosch university and tygerberg hospital in cape town , south africa , the 21-year-old patient was able to have sex with his partner . the operation was carried out by surgeons from stellenbosch university and tygerberg hospital in cape town , south africa , using a donated penis . the man , who has not been named , lost all but a 1cm stump of his penis three years ago following a botched circumcision . he received the donated organ harvested from a man who was declared brain dead . professor graewe said the recipient had accepted the new organ as ` his own ' -- and added the skin tone of the donor penis is similar to that of the patient . as part of the procedure , doctors transplanted a new penis , donated by a deceased man . the pictures , left and right , show the veins and blood vessels they connected . ` it will never be 100 per cent similar , because even when the individuals have the same skin colour , complexions differ , ' the doctor added . ten years ago , a man in china received a transplant , but asked surgeons to remove the donated penis two weeks after the operation . professor andré van der merwe , who led the operation on december 11 last year , had spent years experimenting on cadavers to see which nerves , blood vessels and other elements had to be joined to guarantee full functioning . the procedure was performed as part of a pilot study to develop a penile transplant procedure that could be performed in a typical south african hospital . the planning and preparation for the study started back in 2010 . after extensive research professor van der merwe and his surgical team decided to use techniques developed for the first facial transplant . ` there are a number of men who would benefit from this operation but the issue is a lack of donors and also a lack of funding , ' he told mailonline last week . a follow-up operation enabled the young man to urinate normally , without the aid of a catheter , and the doctors said his overall confidence had risen considerably since the procedure . the man has made a full recovery - a result which the doctors did not expect to occur until about december 2016 . after the nine hour operation , the man recovered rapidly . the procedure has allowed him to become sexually active again . the picture shows how the nerves of the donated penis were joined to the man 's genital region . professor van der merwe said they were surprised by the patient 's rapid recovery . he said : ` our goal was that he would be fully functional at two years and we are very surprised by his rapid recovery . ' the recipient had sought medical help after being left with a non-functioning stump following a bungled procedure by an inept traditional ` surgeon ' . as many as 250 men are estimated to lose their penises each year in a secret and brutal initiation ceremony conducted by the xhosa tribe in south africa . during the month of june , which marks the start of a new harvest , thousands of boys are sent naked into remote areas to survive with little more than a blanket and meagre rations . the ritual is known as ukwaluka and has been practiced for generations . the ultimate test of the rite of passage is the process of ukwaluka - the cutting of the penis foreskin that is done by an incibi - a traditional surgeon - which symbolises the beginning of manhood . however , infections and other complications are coming causing the death of scores of teenagers . each year , there are repeated calls for the ritual to be stopped . prof van der mewe said the success of the procedure meant it could eventually also be extended to men who have lost their penises from penile cancer or as a last-resort treatment for severe erectile dysfunction due to the side effects from medication . image shows the nerves in the donated penis , which were joined to the man 's groin area . this was the first successful operation of its kind , as a previous attempt did not lead to long-term recovery . while full statistics are not available on the number of non medical circumcisions carried out in eastern and southern africa , reports from the world health organization show it is as low as 2 per cent in parts of south africa and up to 35 % per cent in kenya , cnn reports . professor van der merwe said : ` the heroes in all of this for me are the donor , and his family . they saved the lives of many people because they donated the heart , lungs , kidneys , liver , skin , corneas , and then the penis . ' professor graewe said : ` it 's a massive breakthrough . we 've proved that it can be done -- we can give someone an organ that is just as good as the one that he had . ' ` it was a privilege to be part of this first successful penis transplant in the world . ' nine more patients will now receive penile transplants . the south african government praised the surgeons who performed the operation . dr beth engelbrecht , head of western cape government health , said : ` we are very proud to be part of this ground-breaking scientific achievement . ` it is good to know that a young man 's life has been significantly changed with this very complex surgical feat . ` from experience we know that penile dysfunction and disfigurement has a major adverse psychological effect on people .

archaeology by braille ' </s><summ-content>the first artifacts from the confederate civil war ship css georgia have been recovered . the ship , which was built in 1862 but never fired a shot in the civil war , has begun yielding items that have n't seen the surface for 150 years before being excavated near savannah , georgia . among the 400 recently recovered bits of history include leg irons worn by prisoners on the ship and cannon firing equipment . scroll down for video . divers have recovered 400 artifacts from the css georgia , which is being excavated after sitting in the savannah river for the last 150 years . above , leg irons for prisoners were smoothmetal before corrosion . civil war items recovered from the sunken ship including cannon equipment including a iron gun carriage trunnion cap -lrb- above -rrb- , which allowed gunners to aim their weapons . though the css georgia never fired a shot during the civil war , leg irons were likely used to keep deserts locked aboard . the css georgia has sat at the bottom of the water along its namesake state 's coast since it was deliberately sunk by its crew in 1864 to prevent it from being taken by the approaching united states army of major general william sherman . the iron clad ship , estimated to be up to 250 feet long , was too heavy to move under its own weight and was kept stationary at the mouth of the savannah river with a large supply of cannons . it is listed on the national register of historic places , but an agreement was made to explore its contents before deepening its resting place , according to the army corps of engineers savannah district . artifacts from the lost ship will be studied by researchers from texas a&m university 's conservation research laboratory , with hopes that many will eventually be displayed in museums . there is only one photo thought to show the css georgia during its time being used by confederate troops . big items such as the ship 's cannons will be taken out of the water in the summer , though equipment for the guns is already being recovered by divers . because of bad visibility near the sediment of the river , divers are forced to use their sense of touch to find artifacts such as a cannon trunnion cap -lrb- left -rrb- and a serving dish -lrb- right -rrb- . iron eyes for tackle -lrb- above -rrb- assisted the css georgia 's crew in moving their guns into firing positions aimed along the savannah river . a group of divers led by principal investigator stephen james are scouring 40 feet below the water 's surface . however , sediment conditions at the bottom of the savannah make visibility in the water next to nothing , meaning that divers contracted to find the historic items are searching with their hands rather than their eyes . ` you are doing archaeology by braille , ' conservation research laboratory project manager jim jobling told daily mail online . the divers use a 3d positioning system created by previous sonar studies of the ship wreckage , though the skilled archaeologists may only be able to complete a couple of 10ft by 10ft grids because they can only work during high and low tide . they hope their rewards will help enhance knowledge of the mysterious ship , for which historians have found no building plans . the excavation process began in january , but larger items will be recovered in the summer when navy salvage teams arrive . thousands are artifacts from the 1860s are expected to be found , including artillery shells , four cannons , two engines and a propeller , according to cnn . mr jobling said that all ordnances , including possible ammunition in the cannons , will need to be neutralized by the marines before being studied . while iron items have survived long years and are in various states of corrosion , wooden bits of the ship have largely deteriorated . due to limited resources during the civil war , the builders of the css georgia used railroad irons to armor the ship 's sides . researchers hope that personal items such as this ironstone pottery will help illuminate what life aboard the ship was like for soldiers . due to limited resources , the ship used railroad iron to armor its slanted sides , called casemates , which were about 12 feet high . sections of the casemates will be recovered after the current small item phase and the large weapons in the summer . many items such as the cannons will have excess material removed after they are transported to texas by placing them in 1,300 gallon electrolytic tanks with sodium hydroxide solution . conservators are hoping the remaining bits of ship and personal items will help tell about what life aboard the ship was like for crew . mr jobling has already been contacted by historians and researchers from around the country . he says that beyond written descriptions of the civil war , the actual artifacts ` really brings it home ' and help students of the period piece together day-to-day life . a man recently snapped a copy of the only known photo of the ship at a georgia garage sale , though he did not have the money to take the important artifact home . conservators are appealing to the public to help find the photo or others like it to add to their knowledge of the vessel . css is the abbreviation used for confederate states ship , as opposed to uss for united states ship . it was made after a group called the ladies gunboat association of savannah raised $ 115,000 during the war for its construction . the process of removing the css georgia 's to deepen the savannah harbor costs about $ 15million . the css georgia is technically owned by the us navy , which classifies it as a ` captured enemy vessel , ' according to the army . though many iron items remain , pieces of wood -lrb- pictured -rrb- are either entirely or mostly deteriorated from years underwater . the us army corps of engineers has used previous dives to map where they will recover larger items such as cannons and a propeller . as opposed to modern battleships or earlier galleons , gunboats during the civil war sometimes used a slanted body composed of casemates .

'' ' being woken by the screams of other hostages as they were tortured in their cells was commonplace . on one occasion , the spaniard notes , a young boy was beaten to a pulp after being caught smoking - a forbidden habit under oppressive sharia law . the european and american hostages who disappeared had been either freed or moved , mr espinosa claims to have been told . instead they were being picked off one by own , their deaths showcased to the world in barbaric propaganda videos . while the journalist does n't describe in depth any hopes he had of escaping , he revealed that asking his captors how to pray was among his first actions once taken . in march last year mr espinosa , a veteran journalist for the spanish national newspaper el mundo , and mr vilanova were taken into the care of turkish authorities after six months of captivity . once across the border he contacted his newspaper and his wife who later tweeted : ` pure happiness ' . to secure his release the spanish government is understood to have paid a sum to the terror group . france , italy , and germany are other countries to have complied with extremists demands to ensure the release of kidnapped citizens . britain and the u.s. are the only two to have stayed true to a un agreement not to give in to such requests . as a result , jihadis claim , a handful of journalists and aid workers from both countries have been slaughtered . his first victim : american journalist james foley was the first western citizen to have been killed on film by jihadi john in a sickening propaganda video . slaughtered : britons alan henning -lrb- left -rrb- and david haines -lrb- right -rrb- are among the hostages who were savagely murdered by the group . mohammed emwazi was unmasked as jihadi john . the son of a kuwaiti minicab driver , young emwazi arrived in britain speaking only a few words of english , and appeared more interested in football than in islam . he went to mosque with his family , who spoke arabic to each other , but wore western clothing and became popular with his british classmates at st mary magdalene church of england primary school in maida vale , west london . after finishing primary school in 1999 , young mohammed moved to quintin kynaston community academy , in st john 's wood , where he is believed to have studied alongside former x factor judge and pop star tulisa contostavlos . once there , he became more observant of his religion and began wearing more traditional islamic dress , and his sisters began to wear the hijab . the university has since been linked with several proponents of radical islam , and emwazi appeared to have fallen under their sway . he began attending different mosques and was known to associate with bilal el-berjawi , who was killed by a drone strike in somalia three years ago . in august 2009 , after his graduation , emwazi flew to tanzania in east africa with friends and told authorities they were going on a wildlife safari . but the group was refused entry and put on a plane to the netherlands , where emwazi later claimed he was questioned by an mi5 agent called nick . the british officer accused him of planning to travel to somalia to join the militant group al shabaab , he said , and said mi5 had been watching him . emwazi denied the accusation -- bragging that he would not take a designer rocawear sweater in his luggage if he was planning to join somalian rebels . in emails to the campaign group cage , emwazi said : ` he -lsb- nick -rsb- knew everything about me ; where i lived , what i did , the people i hanged around with . ' ` nick ' then tried to recruit the 21-year-old , emwazi claimed , and threatened him when he refused to cooperate . emwazi said the officer told him : ` you 're going to have a lot of trouble ... you 're going to be known ... you 're going to be followed ... life will be harder for you . ' on his return to britain , emwazi said his family told him they had been ` visited ' , and he claimed a woman he had been planning to marry broke off their engagement because her family had also been contacted and were scared . according to emwazi , his family then began planning for him to travel to kuwait to get him away from the ` harassment ' he had suffered in britain and he went to work for a computer programming company in the emirate . in 2013 after changing his name by deed poll he made another attempt to enter kuwait but was rejected . disappearing from home he was not seen again until appearing in isis propaganda films , his face masked as he slit the throats of innocents . his identity was revealed last month . he has not appeared in online footage since .

' i reported it to the head and she responded by disciplining the child but then started calling the child `` pom-pom head '' herself . ` she would use words like horrible , nasty and unkind to describe pupils . i saw her slam the door so hard when yelling at a pupil it shook the walls . ` she also called a special educational needs child a freak show . ' another teacher at the school , elizabeth bashford , described how miss gretton mocked colleagues , claiming one left her job after feeling ` victimised and bullied ' . she also claimed the head had been racist about an applicant for a job at the school . miss bashford said : ' a vacancy position came up and miss gretton said `` why would you send a photo with an application when you look like that ?

' a lot of people told me that they wanted to keep their heads down and stay out of it . the hearing was also told how mrs gretton had cctv camerasput in place at burton joyce primary , pictured , to intimidate staff . ` from the start it was clear that the staff were terrified of the head and they did not trust me to begin with . ' i have found the whole time i was there disturbing that someone could do so much damage . it has been the most difficult two years of my life . ' i did not know anything about the school until about 7.30 am the morning before i started . when i got there the school was in a state of disarray . ` the site manager was absent , the grounds maintenance contract was cancelled and the school was a complete disaster zone to be honest . ` things like the normal structures you would expect were not there like phone recording systems and the health and safety was disgraceful . ` the office manager was away due to the behaviour of miss gretton and she told me that herself . ` things were in place to undermine the staff like there were no tea or coffee facilities and she only had meetings with team leaders and not the whole cohort .

' i was told about messages being passed saying that she knew what was going on and that there would be retribution when she comes back . ` the teachers were scared and worried about these messages .

' i asked the headteacher to elaborate which religions and which cultures ? but he said it had to be confidential . he referred us to the formal complaints procedure . ` what is the head 's future after all of this ? i consider this totally unacceptable . i think he should be considering his position . ' many parents voiced their concerns at the fact they had not been informed of the ` last-minute ' decision by the school . khairoe islam , whose son goes to the school , said : ` i 'm muslim myself and in my religion it does n't say we ca n't watch it . ' i do n't know anything about it but if they say it 's because of religion maybe they could have spoken to those people who had a problem and let the other kids enjoy it . ` it should n't be spoiled for the rest of the school . ' pupils at north primary school in southall , london , were banned from watching today 's once-in-a-generation eclipse because of ` religious and cultural reasons ' phil belman , whose seven-year-old daughter goes to the school , said the decision was like ` going back to the dark ages ' north primary school , situated in the mount pleasant ward of southall in ealing , was rated ` outstanding ' in its last ofsted report in march 2013 . but this rating was largely attributed to the ` exceptional ' then head teacher rebecca hastings , who left her post last summer . the report said : ` the headteacher provides outstanding leadership based on a clear vision for the school . ` she has taken staff , at all levels , with her on the road to excellence and this is a tribute to her personal dedication and care for others . ` because she has been able to communicate her vision for the school so well , staff are very well motivated and work exceptionally hard and successfully to make the vision a reality . ' after she left , she was replaced by ` interim headteacher ' ivor johnstone . harpreet kaur , whose siblings go to the primary school , said : ` the school did n't say anything to us . ` they told the children it was for religious and cultural reasons and they were told they could n't see it outside . ' i do n't think it was made very clear , even to the teachers . a friend of mine who is a teacher at the school said she did n't understand it . ' i think it was quite a last-minute decision . ` it 's a shame because even though it was cloudy there is still the excitement of going outside and having a look . ` there 's quite a large muslim community in the school and someone said it has something to do with that . ' i did some reading up on it but could n't find anything . maybe it 's some obscure reason . ' mr johnstone admitted pupils had been prevented from watching the first solar eclipse of this century after ` religious and cultural concerns associated with observing one directly ' were raised . it is not yet clear exactly what these concerns are , but christian ministers have raised fears that this eclipse could signal the end of the world , or a judgement from god . some hindu scriptures say that an eclipse makes believers impure . and fundamentalists believe that they need to bathe immediately after an eclipse and chant the name of god to overcome the forces of darkness . headteacher ivor johnstone said he was unable to elaborate on the decision because of ` confidentiality ' the headteacher said : ` the school made this decision when we became aware of religious and cultural concerns associated with observing an eclipse directly . ` although we are sorry for any disappointment , pupils were still able to watch the eclipse on screens in classrooms . however , the overcast conditions in west london today meant they would not have been able to see it live in any case . ' mohammed babar , whose five-year-old daughter zahra is a pupil at the school , said : ` there is no cultural reason that i am aware of . if that 's what they said then it would surprise me . ' ealing council confirmed the pupils were not allowed out of their classrooms but said they were able to see the eclipse on tv screens . a spokesman said the council was currently investigating the claims and asked the school for further clarification about why the children were prevented from watching the eclipse . parents of children at north primary school in southall , london , said they were ` outraged ' by the decision to prevent children from watching the eclipse . north primary , which is not a faith school , describes itself online as ` multicultural with a welcoming ethos ' . in the summer of july 2014 , complaints made by a number of teachers led to an investigation by governors of the school . sometimes known as little india , southall is a diverse community in west london with a large hindi population . the school has 407 pupils on roll and around 97 per cent speak english as an additional language . a substantial minority of them are refugees and there are a few pupils from traveller families . the news from southall comes after it emerged that school children across the country were forced to watch the eclipse on tv due to safety fears . the decision by head teachers angered parents , who wanted their children to experience the rare celestial event without sitting in front of a screen . oldway primary school in paignton , devon , is one of the schools which came under fire for keeping children inside . head teacher jane smythe said she had 700 children to look after and she ` could not guarantee that they would not look at the sun ' . isabel stevenson , a mother-of-four from glasgow , added : ` so not happy about secondary school my kids go to doing nothing for solar eclipse tomorrow ! livid and furious . i 'm on a mission today . ' north primary school , which is non-denominational , is rated as outstanding by ofsted . its cultural policy states : ` we are committed to an inclusive ethos based on the respect for and positive acknowledgement of ethnic , cultural and religious diversity . ` we strive to prepare all pupils for living in a multi-cultural , multi-faith and multi-ethnic society and are committed to promoting race equality in all dimensions of the school 's life and community .

<s> disadvantaged pupils less likely to score well in science and humanities . </s> <s> pupils who do not study these less likely to go to russell group university . </s> <s> but going to decent nursery and reading for pleasure can boost chances of good results . </s><summ-content>bright children from poor backgrounds are half as likely as their richer peers to succeed in tougher a-level subjects , a study shows . researchers found those from disadvantaged families were far less likely to study and score highly in english , maths , science , humanities and languages . pupils who do not take these so-called ` facilitating ' subjects have less chance of obtaining a place at the prestigious russell group universities , which often favour them . bright children from poor backgrounds are half as likely as their richer peers to succeed in tougher a-level subjects , a study shows -lrb- file picture -rrb- . researchers commissioned by the department of education at oxford university also found poor children are much less likely to get three a-levels in any courses . the wide-ranging study also showed that going to a decent nursery , reading for pleasure and attending an outstanding school can boost a disadvantaged pupil 's chances of getting good results . taking part in school trips and getting into a daily homework routine can also help them . the research is based on data drawn from more than 3,000 young people who have been tracked from the age of three for the effective pre-school , primary and secondary education -lrb- eppse -rrb- project . researchers found that just a third of bright but disadvantaged students took one of more a-levels facilitating subjects , compared to 58 per cent of their wealthier peers with the same academic ability . less than a fifth of the poor students followed gained at least a b in these subjects , compared to 41 per cent of their advantaged classmates . the findings also show that just over 35 per cent of the sixth-formers identified as clever based on their test results at age 11 got three a-levels in any subjects , compared to 60 per cent of their high-achieving , richer peers . an analysis of the data found that sixth-formers who did two to three hours of homework each night were nine times more likely to gain three a-levels than those who did none . less than a fifth of the poor students followed gained at least a b in these subjects , compared to 41 per cent of their advantaged classmates -lrb- file picture -rrb- . the study said : ` spending time on homework is likely to reflect both student motivation and engagement , study skills and independence , school policies and the priority teachers attach to encouraging students to study at home -lrb- or provide opportunities after school -rrb- , as well as parental attitudes and support . ' the study concludes that encouraging reading for pleasure , educational trips , the chance to go to a good nursery and school , feedback on school work and a supportive home life can help disadvantaged youngsters to get good results . it suggests that bright , poor students should get ` enrichment ' vouchers , funded through the pupil premium - public funding for disadvantaged children - to help with educational trips , reading for pleasure and studies outside of the classroom . sir peter lampl , chairman of the sutton trust which commissioned the report , said : ` the fact that bright disadvantaged students fall so far behind when they reach their a-levels shows that government and schools urgently need to do more to support able students from less advantaged homes . ` we must ensure that access to the best schools and opportunities for academic enrichment outside school are available to all students . it is also vital that schools advise their students on the right subject choices at gcse and a-level so as to maximise their potential . ' professor pam sammons , co-author of the report , said : ` there is no silver bullet that alone can make a difference but a combination of good schools and pre-schools , the right home learning environment and supportive teachers ready to monitor progress and provide good feedback can all ensure that bright but disadvantaged students get the chance of a good university education . there are important lessons here for teachers and policymakers seeking to reduce the equity gap in attainment .

' -lsb- it -rsb- was n't until i saw feathers that i realized what was going on . ' ` my jaw hit the ice , ' colangelo told the washington post . ' i was absolutely shocked . ' colangelo said that though he and his friends go fishing regularly and have seen mergansers dive under water for long stretches of time , he was n't expecting to catch the bird on his fishing line . ` i 've never heard of anything like this happening , ' he told the washington post . ` it was so unusual . ' in the video , christensen can be seen pulling up the fishing line out of a small hole in the water until he eventually reaches his hand in and pulls out a squirming live bird . unexpected : fred christensen , pictured on monday , said he was n't sure what he was pulling up on the line , but he was certain it was n't a fish . unusual : christensen was hesitant to reach into the water at first , but he grabbed the merganser and likely saved it from drowning on the end of the fishing line . after christensen posed for a picture , the men untangled the bird and set it free into it 's natural habitat . ` it did n't take long to realize it was n't happy , i just grabbed the mean end as soon as i saw the chance , ' christensen wrote in an e-mail . ' i figured controlling its head and body would make unhooking and tangling much faster , i treated it the same as i would a fish . thankfully nick was there to help , it would have been a difficult task to accomplish alone , ' he added . colangelo told the washington post that the bird was only minimally tangled and easily made its way back to its flock . christensen said that he had never heard of people catching a merganser through the ice , but said that it occasionally happens ` in open water in ares where large amounts of water birds like to congregate ' . the three fishermen do n't kill anything that they catch while fishing and release it all back into the wild . ' i would just sincerely like to say that the environment , the fish the birds - that 's what 's high priority , ' colangelo told the washington post . catch-and-release : red-breasted mergansers dive into the water looking for food . the men untangled the bird from their fishing line and set it free to return to its flock . christensen said that there 's ` no sense in killing ' the fish they catch , and that you never know a fish 's full potential if it 's killed . ` i 've seen and have caught fish i 've released even years prior that have had identifying scars or characteristics that could n't be mistaken , ' he said . ` when you experience catching a fish that you 've caught before it is a good feeling to see that the fish is still alive and well . it gives you that much more incentive to let them all go , ' he added . the three men often fish for musky , a rare and large species that is known to be difficult to catch . the freshwater fish is often spotted around the great lakes region and through canada . colangelo and wholey hit headlines last month after catching a 53-pound musky while ice fishing n northwest pennsylvania , according to cbs . the men estimated that the fish was about 30 years old . they were one pound away from matching a 1949 state record for biggest musky catch . christensen that that three days prior to catching the merganser , he had another unusual bird encounter . ' i watched a bald eagle wipe out a canadian goose and carried it as far as it could until it realized it was extremely heavy , ' he wrote . ` it just so happened it dropped less than ten yards from where i was quietly sitting waiting for a flag to pop . ' ` most would find this crazy uncommon , but for me it 's just a typical day on water , ' the fisherman said . under the ice : christensen , and his friends nicholas colangelo and luke wholey fish for muskies in northwest pennsylvania . reeling it in : the fish , found mostly in the great lakes region and in canada , are rare , large and difficult to catch .

' she said the poison was believed to have been given on a piece of beef that was largely undigested when the autopsy was performed on saturday march 7 - the day jagger died . the club secretary then pointed out that food is usually absorbed in dogs within six hours . three-year-old jagger collapsed and died at his owner 's home in tongeren , belgium , 24 hours after winning a silver medal in his class at world 's biggest dog show , pictured with aleksandra lauwers 's son jeremy . her comments were made amid fears that at least six dogs were deliberately poisoned at the world famous show . but she said there was no evidence that any of the dogs taken ill at crufts were actually given poison while at the show . ` we must stress that despite reports to the contrary which have caused a lot of concern to dog lovers , absolutely no dog has been shown to have been sick at or after crufts due to poison ingested at the show , there are no veterinary reports or evidence to support this notion , and no official reports of poisoning have been made to the police , ' she said . ` we have a lot of security measures in place to protect the dogs at our show and we continually review our procedures because the welfare and safety of the dogs is our first and main priority . ` regardless of the fact that the poison was not ingested at crufts a dog has very sadly died and we must now respect the owners ' privacy and give them time to grieve . ' jagger suffered a fit and fell into a coma before dying in aleksandra 's arms back at the family home in the city of tongeren , in belgium . two types of insecticides - called aldicarb and carbofuran - were to blame for jagger 's death . she revealed a post mortem by a vet found cubes of meat laced with a toxin in his stomach and thought he may have been targeted at the show at birmingham 's nec . the family 's vet dr patrick jans said jagger fell ill so suddenly that it is more likely he ate the toxins shortly before he died . speaking for the first time about the tragedy , he told the mail : ` i doubt that it happened at crufts . i think it 's unlikely because of the long time delay . ` i am surprised at everyone saying that this was the case . ' nick sutton , health information officer at the kennel club , added : ` regardless of the specifics surrounding this particular tragic incident , where jagger 's owners suspect malicious intent , this tragedy has shone the spotlight very firmly on the issue of poisoning . ` it is important that dog owners know that the majority of poison related deaths and illnesses in dogs in the uk are accidental . ` some accidents could potentially be avoided if dog owners were to be aware of the common household and garden items that can be harmful to dogs , including chocolate , raisins , onions , some pesticides and garden plants , detergents and many human medicines . ' the three-year-old irish setter was ` best friend ' to the couple 's son , jeremy . the family have vowed to find the person responsible for his ` slow and painful ' death . aleksandra lauwers -lrb- pictured with jeremy and the litter jagger was born part of -rrb- said she and her son are struggling to cope with the dog 's death . aldicarb and carbofuran are carbamate insecticides which are used in agriculture - but are not approved for use in the eu . nick edwards , senior information scientist for veterinary poisons information service , said : ` we understand that the toxicology report says carbofuran and aldicarb , toxic carbamate pesticides - which are no longer approved for use in the eu - were found . ` we would expect the clinical effects , if ingested by a dog , to be rapid in onset ; normally between half an hour and three hours . ` after this time a combination of clinical effects , if the toxins were taken in sufficient quantities , would likely be present , including weakness , collapse , diarrhoea , slow heart rate , difficulty in breathing and excessive salivation .

' he said past medications used to treat migraines -- beta-blockers , anti-depressants , and epilepsy medicines -- are ` borrowed ' from other specialities , whereas this injection works specifically for migraines . while internal or outside influences can bring on a migraine , the mechanism by which one is triggered is understood . a combination of chemical reactions occurs that results in a chemical called the calcitonin gene-related peptide -lrb- cgrp -rrb- being produced and released . cgrp causes the swelling of blood vessels that are intertwined with nerve endings of the trigeminal nerve , which is located on both sides of the head . this leads to a painful headache , sometimes with aura -- meaning the person experiences visual disturbances , dizziness and vertigo -- as well as nausea and vomiting . researchers found monoclonal blood proteins -- antibodies specifically engineered to bind to cgrp -- were able to ` mop up ' the chemical , meaning a migraine was not triggered . these treatments all have side effects , whereas none have been identified for the new injection . it also prevents the onset of migraines , rather than treating them when a headache has come on . he said : ` if you have 15 days or more and you 're just chasing the headaches it 's not a good strategy . no side effects have been identified . as the injection will be expensive , he expects the injections to be offered as a last resort , after the first line treatments such as antidepressants have been tried . wendy thomas , chief executive of the migraine trust , said : ` many chronic migraine patients find existing treatments are ineffective , or cause unpleasant side effects . this breakthrough has the potential to give them back a more normal life . ' due to the way and how long sufferers are affected , people with chronic migraine take considerably more time off work , school , leisure , housework and social activities than episodic migraine patients . efficiency is also hit , with work or school productivity more than halved - described as a migraine ` hangover ' by numerous sufferers . incapacity for over half a month sometimes means people can not work at all , with some claiming disability living allowance . if the treatment given in the trials passes further tests , the injections could become available within a few years . the next step will be a phase iii trial on a larger population of people , in which the injection will be tested against a placebo .

' another fan , who said he was a doctor at the whittington , wrote : ` as much as i 'd jump at the opportunity to help you if i actually was on call tonight , please try to understand . ` us healthcare professionals do n't want anyone to wait or suffer at all . ` however , we encounter life-threatening conditions every hour , sometimes every minute , that stop us from seeing others that may be slightly less unwell , as quickly as we 'd like . ` waiting sucks , i know , but dying patients suck even more . ' the intensity of the row provoked portnoy 's wife , marlene portnoy , 51 , to leap to his defence . ` some of you people are just so horrible , ' she said . ` he did n't ask for special treatment because he was famous , his concern was the fans that paid good money to see a concert that was about to get cancelled . ' portnoy later apologised to staff at the whittington . end of the road : an ambulance is parked outside the whittington hospital , london . an american rock star , mike portnoy , 47 , has complained that when he fell ill in london , a paramedic team was unable to transfer him to hospital because their ambulance had run out of petrol . ` it was not a personal attack or rage against england 's health care system in general , of which i know nothing about , ' he said . ' i did not expect any special treatment or wanted to be put ahead of anybody else in need . we only wanted some answers as the clock was ticking until showtime .

' however , a paris court ruled yesterday that facebook 's clause forcing all users to agree that any litigation must be based in the u.s. state , where the site is based , was ` abusive ' . mr cottineau hailed the court ruling as a ` first victory won by david against goliath ' . ` this decision will create jurisprudence for other social media and other internet giants who use their being headquartered abroad , mainly in the united states , to attempt to evade french law . ' the lawyer said this was an ` abusive clause ' as none of the 22 million facebook users in france ` can ever take recourse to french legal jurisdiction in the event of a dispute .

' -lrb- i told them -rrb- my career may be brief . i did a lot of research during the season and afterwards and came to the conclusion it was best for me , ' said borland . having made his mind up , borland became the first high-profile player to walk away from his nfl career citing brain damage worries . ` the decision was simple after i had done a lot of research and it was personal , ' borland said to face the nation . ' i was concerned about neurological diseases down the road if i continued to play football , so i did a lot of research and gathered a lot of information and to me the decision made sense . ' sensation : san francisco 49ers linebacker chris borland is retiring from the nfl over health concerns related to repeated head trauma . last week , the nfl moved quickly to head off the damage done by borland as the league battles with the rising concern over the number of concussions that players are suffering during their playing days . the nfl 's senior vice president of health and safety said that , by any measure , football has never been safer and we continue to make progress with rule changes , safer tackling techniques at all levels of football , and better equipment , protocols and medical care for players . ' ` we are seeing a growing culture of safety . everyone involved in the game knows that there is more work to do and player safety will continue to be our top priority , ' he said . however , borland refuted that and said , ` football is inherently dangerous and that will never change . ' while most people would consider walking away from a multi-million dollar contract to be madness , borland said that at the very least he would want young players to stop playing if they were suffering a concussion . backing : tim kawakami from the san jose mercury news tweeted that he found the culture of football - and the lifestyle that comes with it - to be changing . ' i love the visceral feeling of the violence of the game ; i think everyone that plays at a high level is passionate about that , ' he said to face the nation . ` however i do n't think you should n't be informed and you should have every opportunity to know all you can about the dangers of that feeling that you love and the sport that you 're passionate about . ' hitting back at those who said he played for one year just to take home a lucrative payday ahead of another player who wanted it more , borland said that was not true . i 'm paying back three fourths of my signing bonus . i 'm only taking the money i 've earned , ' he said . ` this to me this is just about health and nothing else . i never played the game for money and attention . i love football and i 've had a blast . i do n't regret the last 10 years of my life at all . i 'd do it over the exact same way .

' i used to think that 99 % of players would n't be able to pull themselves away from this -- the game , the fame , the lifestyle . but ... ' kawakami wrote . ` but the perspective is changing . chris borland just put himself at the forefront of that , and he obviously did it with a lot of thought .

' reluctantly , the couple agreed to an induced abortion and catherine took medication to start the process . two days later , after a bout of heavy bleeding , catherine returned to salford royal hospital to complete the abortion . there -- much to her astonishment and delight -- a further scan , carried out before a second drug was administered , detected a heartbeat . the girl they had hoped would complete their family had not died as the hospital had said . and against all the odds , she had survived the ill-advised abortion . though thrilled , the couple now face an agonising wait until their daughter is born , fearing she will have long-term health problems as a result of the medication that was intended to induce the abortion . to make matters worse , doctors have told them that the heavy bleeding catherine suffered could have been a miscarriage of a possible twin -- killed by the procedure . as catherine and andrew struggle to understand how it could have happened , and what it could mean for them , the nhs hospital has launched an urgent investigation . doctors have warned them they can not be sure their little girl will not suffer birth defects because the abortion pill was administered during the critical 12-week development period for the foetus . the couple have decided to speak of their experience in the hope that hospitals will ensure they perform a second scan with a different sonographer if it is suspected a baby has died in the womb . ` to say this has ruined my pregnancy would be an understatement , ' says laboratory manager catherine , 32 , who is now 26 weeks pregnant and already has a son thomas , two . ` our little girl is a much-wanted baby and we are extremely worried she wo n't now be born healthy . we are incredibly angry and upset . we ca n't understand how doctors could have made such a big error . ` in hindsight we believe a scan should have been carried out before i took the pill to double-check the diagnosis that the baby had died . ' yesterday , holding hands with her plasterer husband andrew , also 32 , at their home in walkden , manchester , catherine told how they had desperately wanted a second child . ` we wanted a little brother or sister for thomas and as i 'd had a completely normal pregnancy with him , we had no reason to believe this one would be any different , ' she says . as her periods had been irregular and catherine was unsure how many weeks pregnant she was , her midwife suggested she had a routine ` dating ' ultrasound scan and referred her to salford royal . however , within minutes of doing the scan the sonographer told catherine there was a problem . during a routine scan , medics told catherine her child had died in the womb and that she should start an induced abortion , but the baby survived the process . pictured : a scan of her unborn daughter . ` she could n't detect any heartbeat and in fact said she believed the pregnancy had already started to disintegrate , ' recalls catherine . ` i was told i had three options . i could let a miscarriage occur naturally , which could take weeks , i could have a dilatation and curettage -- an operation under a general anaesthetic to empty my uterus -- or i could take a pill to induce labour . ` i chose the pill because it meant that i could stay at home and would n't have to leave thomas . ' doctors explained she would take the first pill , containing the drug mifepristone , by mouth . it works by blocking the hormone progesterone . without this , the lining of the uterus breaks down . then two days later she would return to the hospital for the final stage , which would involve a second drug , misoprostol , to bring on contractions and expel what remained of the pregnancy . the evening after taking the mifepristone , she began to experience heavy bleeding , but thought it was part of the process . to check the mifepristone had worked , catherine underwent another scan , before taking the misoprostol . she recalls : ` as she did the scan the woman looked concerned . she left and returned with a colleague . after pointing out something on the screen , the colleague nodded and left . ` the woman then turned to me and said she 'd found a heartbeat and estimated i was around seven weeks pregnant . i was amazed and overjoyed . but seconds later i was overcome with shock because i began to worry about how the drug might have harmed my baby . ' shaking , catherine rang andrew who hurried to the hospital . ` by the time he arrived i was in a terrible state , ' she says . ` a consultant came in and said it was our decision , but due to the possible harm our baby may have suffered from the pill , it was still an option to continue with the abortion . however , there was no way , having seen my baby 's heart beating on a scan , i could carry on . ' doctors explained that , as the drug acts by shearing off the embryo from the uterus , they could not guarantee a miscarriage would n't happen in the coming days or weeks . ` because i had such a large bleed , i 've since found out it might be i was pregnant with twins and did in fact miscarry one , ' catherine reveals . ` that was very upsetting . nobody knows for sure but it is heartbreaking to think i might have lost a baby over this . and i have been terrified since that i will lose my baby i am carrying now . ' a spokesman for salford royal -lrb- pictured -rrb- apologised for the error and launched a probe into the incident . since then , catherine has imagined every little twinge is a miscarriage . ` it is a miracle i am still pregnant , but i just have n't been able to relax , ' she says . ` i just wish i had asked for another scan to check , especially as i 'd had no other sign anything was amiss with the pregnancy , but then i trusted the doctors . they 've given me leaflets which explain the drug can be linked to birth defects . some of these might not be immediately noticeable and will only show as our daughter grows . but there 's been hardly any research . i 've been reassured she is growing as expected and i feel happier now i can feel her kicking . but doctors ca n't check for everything . ` i am trying to put what happened to the back of my mind and be positive but then i have moments of despair at night when i fear the worst . it is very hard . ` we have found ourselves in a nightmare situation which could have been avoided . we only hope getting this out into the open will ensure no one suffers as we have . ' jack sharp , executive director at salford royal , said : ` we again apologise unreservedly to mrs urhegyi for the error and the distress this has undoubtedly caused . ` we immediately launched an investigation to understand how the incident happened and how we could prevent it occurring again . this has now concluded and a member of our senior nursing team has arranged to meet with mrs urhegyi in person to share those findings .

' every week members of the studio audience who 've come to see the show being filmed are invited to take part in a few tests before the show begins to see which of them are more susceptible to hypnosis -- and so who is likely to make a fool of themselves and get the biggest laughs . then five are picked to compete in the challenges onstage . ` anyone can be put into a trance but everyone has different levels of susceptibility , ' explains keith . ` one studio audience test i did where i got people to imagine their hands are glued together was classic . many of them , even the cynical ones , found they could n't pull their hands apart . ` once we 've picked our five candidates i take them backstage and put them into a deep trance , which takes about 20 minutes . first i make sure they shut down their physical bodies by getting them to sit comfortably , focus on their breathing and relax . then i get them to imagine they 're at the top of the stairs and to count down , imagining their own choice of colour for the stairs and how many there are as they 're walking down , so that by the time they reach the bottom they 've drifted into a calm hypnotic state . from there i 'm able to implant suggestions into their minds . ' keith then brings the contestants round before they emerge onto the stage . but they 're still in a waking trance , and although they 're speaking and acting normally in this state , keith only has to say the word ` sleep ' and they instantly nod off . at this point he can implant instructions into their minds which will get them to behave totally out of character -- and hinder their progress during each round of games . ` once you 've hypnotised someone once , you can pretty much put them under instantly any time you meet them afterwards , ' says keith . tv chef paul rankin is served dinnerby a hypnotised contestant on the show . the instructions he gives them can have astonishing effects . one episode involves the contestants serving a champagne dinner to four popular tv chefs -- ed baines , aldo zilli , paul rankin and lesley waters -- in a supposedly ` posh ' restaurant . but once keith suggests ideas into their minds , it quickly turns into more of a dog 's dinner . one woman is told she 's lost her expensive ring in the mashed potato , while another participant is convinced the guests are toddlers who need encouragement to eat their food and the girl serving the gravy thinks she 's aboard a ship in rough seas . because detailed portrayal of the way keith manages to put the contestants into a state of deep trance is banned under stage hypnosis laws , it naturally begs the question of whether the participants are acting , or at least playing to the gallery . keith insists it 's all bona fide . ` phillip was sceptical at the outset but he soon realised how real hypnosis is and how it allows people to do things they would n't normally do . after each show he tells the studio audience that he would never have become involved unless he was 100 per cent convinced that everything i do is real . but putting someone into a deep trance ca n't be shown on tv for legal reasons in case someone does it at home and they do n't have me there to wake them up afterwards . ' david behan , a harley street hypnotherapist who treats a range of issues from weight loss to giving up smoking , says , ` people have been using hypnosis to cure themselves and others since ancient egyptian times . paul mckenna brought the positive aspects of hypnosis to the forefront with his tv shows in the 1990s . he showed people how they could utilise hypnosis to help themselves become more confident and conquer anxiety , bed-wetting , losing weight and giving up smoking . but the onus is on the therapist to use this technique in accordance with a moral code . does this show do that ? that 's not for me to say , it will be up to the viewer to decide . lots of people have never seen hypnosis being carried out and may want to investigate more . i know of keith barry but have never met him , but he 's morally bound to make sure no harm comes to anyone taking part . ` hypnosis should be used to help people and not used to encourage others to laugh at them . no one can be forced in their behaviour , under hypnosis they are simply following a suggestion . it 's a heightened state of awareness . perception at its most open . ' whether the show will put off people who might have considered hypnotherapy to help themselves we can never know . keith says at the end of each show his final task is to ` de-fry ' , as he calls it , the five contestants and bring them back to normal consciousness . ' i remove all the game show suggestions i 've implanted in their minds and replace them with confident thoughts so they can look to their futures in a positive way , ' he insists . then he shows them the footage of what they got up to -- and if you want proof of the authenticity of what goes on , married mother kate cook offers it . ` i 'm a bubbly person but there 's no way i would normally have been able to do what i did under hypnosis , ' says kate , 30 . ' i was told to fall in love with phillip schofield . i believed i was utterly in love with him and i believed he loved me too . i was waiting for him to propose to me any moment . it was surreal . meanwhile my husband chris was in the audience and a man next to him , said , ` good grief , can you imagine what her boyfriend will say ? ' chris said , ` that 's my wife ! ' we know we live in an age when people crave to be famous -- or even infamous . kate , like all the other contestants i spoke to afterwards , said how much she enjoyed the whole experience . ross calder , a 33-year-old musician who 'd been told he was naked on stage , told me , ' i truly believed i was naked even though i could see i was actually wearing clothes . but after the show i felt energised -- as if i could accomplish anything . ' those who believe in self-control will watch with their hands over their eyes but phillip schofield , who is no doubt hoping it will get similar sort of ratings to bgt , is convinced it will be a hit . ` it 's absolutely hysterical . i had no idea what to expect , but the contestants completely lose their inhibitions under hypnosis . i think one of the highlights was kate professing her love for me -- you really have to see it to believe it .

' the researchers , whose work on the fossil is published in the journal science , say the fossil could be a key missing link between the homo lineage and a more primitive and ape-like rival branch of the hominin evolutionary tree called australopithecus . details of the australopithecus are best known from a fossil named ` lucy ' , dating back 3.2 million years , which was discovered in ethiopia in 1974 . but exactly how homo habilis had appeared was unclear due to a huge gap in the fossil record . the new discovery has helped to fill that gap . scientists say it can provide important clues to the changes in jaw and teeth that distinguished members of the homo family from those belonging to australopithecus . until now the earliest evidence of the existence of the first homo species was 2.3 million to 2.4 million year old fossils . scientists have been searching for decades for earlier examples in an attempt to understand how our ancestors split from other ape-like hominins . dr william kimbel , director of the institute of human origins at arizona state university who was also involved in the research , said : ` the ledi jaw helps narrow the evolutionary gap between australopithecus and early homo . ` it 's an excellent case of a transitional fossil in a critical time period in human evolution . ' the images above show the jawbone from different angles and how many of the teeth still remain in place . anthropologists digging tin the ledi-geraru , pictured above , discovered the new jawbone in january 2013 . the jawbone was found in the ledi-geraru area , marked with a star on the map above , of ethiopia . the fossilised jawbone was first discovered by student chalachew seyoum from the authority for research and conservation of cultural heritage in ethiopia in january 2013 . it is thought to be the left side of an adult 's lower jawbone that has canine , premolars and three molars still preserved in the jaw . mr seyoum said he was ` stunned ' when he saw the fossil . ` the moment i found it , i realised that it was important , as this is the time period represented by few fossils in eastern africa , ' he told bbc news last night . dating of the fossil and the surrounding sediment suggest it is between 2.8 million and 2.75 million years old . other fossils of antelope , prehistoric elephants and hippos discovered alongside the jawbone suggest that this early homo species lived in open grassland and shrub habitats . this matches the picture that scientists believe was occurring around this time of climate change creating increasingly arid conditions in africa . these are thought to be one of the main driving forces that led to the evolution of the homo lineage and eventually our own species . australopithecus , by contrast , was thought to inhabit far wetter environments and this may have contributed to their eventual demise . the researchers said that the changes in the new jawbone compared to australopithecus suggest that evolution of different jaw shapes may have been a key step in the divergence of the two lineages . professor kaye reed , also from arizona state university , said : ` we can see the 2.8 million year aridity signal in the ledi-geraru faunal community , but it 's still too soon to say that this means climate change is responsible for the origin of homo . ' the new fossil has helped fill a huge gap in the evolutionary history -lrb- above -rrb- of how the homo family appeared . another study published in the journal nature has also provided convincing evidence that ld 350-1 was a common human ancestor to the homo family . they used 3d imaging techniques to scan partial skull of homo habilis - a human ancestor that lived 1.8 million years ago and is thought to have been among the first to use tools - earning it the nickname ` handy man ' . it reveals an unexpectedly primitive structure , indicating that the species may have originated at least 2.3 million years ago and allowed the researchers to draw conclusions about what their ancestors jaw would have looked like . their findings suggest that three different species of early human existed side-by-side between 2.1 million and 1.6 million years ago - homo habilis , homo erectus and homo rudolfensis . scientists used 3d imaging techniques to reconstruct the skull of homo hablis -lrb- left -rrb- which has provided clues about how this now extinct member of our evolutionary branch would have looked . the image on the right shows an early reconstruction of homo hablis at the westfälisches museum for archaology in herne . they found that the ancestor of homo habilis would have had features similar to those found in the fossilised jawbone ld 350-1 . professor fred spoor , a researcher of evolutionary anatomy at university college london and the max planck institute in germany , said : ` by digitally exploring what homo habilis really looked like we could infer the nature of its ancestor , but no such fossils were known . ` now the ledi-geraru jaw has turned up as if ` on request ' , suggesting a plausible evolutionary link between australopithecus afarensis and homo habilis . ' this reconstruction of the jaw of homo habilis by the ucl team shows that it was more primitive than the jaws of homo erectus or homo sapiens and was more similar to the jaw of australopithecus afarensis . dr simon underdown , an anthropologist at oxford brookes university , said the discovery of ld 350-1 could help scientists unravel the complex beginnings of our own species . he said : ` it gives us a better understanding of what was happening at the earlier end of the genus homo . ` finds like kenyanthropus -lrb- a 3.5 million year old ape-like species -rrb- have made it harder to understand the relationship between the australopithecines and us - in short it 's the replacement of the old fashioned unilinear model of a evolutionary branch with a multiple species based evolutionary bush . ` what 's becoming clear is that we have only a small part of the jigsaw puzzle . this new fossil may well be a member of our genus , an australopithecine or an hitherto unknown genus .

<s> the case has been brought by erika rosenberg , an argentinian woman . </s> <s> rosenberg is the heir of the german industrialist 's late wife , emilie . </s> <s> she claims that this gives her ownership of the famous documents . </s><summ-content>forty years after his death , a legal battle yesterday began to play out in a jerusalem court over documents belonging to oskar schindler including personal copies of the lists of jews he saved from the holocaust . the case has been brought by erika rosenberg , an argentinian woman , who is suing jerusalem 's yad vashem holocaust museum over a suitcase containing thousands of schindler 's documents . the case sheds unusual light on schindler 's personal life after he saved some 1,200 jews from the nazis during world war ii , and the battles over his estate . visitors at the yad vashem holocaust museum in jerusalem walk past a portrait of oskar schindler , who saved some 1,200 jews from the nazis during world war ii . argentinian erika rosenberg is suing the museum over a suitcase containing thousands of schindler 's documents . an ultra-orthodox jewish man looks at facsimiles of oskar schindler 's lists displayed for the public at the yad vashem holocaust memorial in jerusalem , where the original documents are being stored in the museum 's archives . the yad vashem holocaust museum insists the documents it received in 1999 never belonged to emilie schindler , seen here during a 1993 ceremony for her late husband in buenos aires . schindler 's story captured public attention with spielberg 's 1993 oscar-winning movie . rosenberg claims ownership of the documents by virtue of being the heir of the german industrialist 's late wife , emilie . the suitcase and the documents have been held since 1999 by yad vashem , which insists they never belonged to emilie schindler but were passed on by oskar schindler to a third party before his death . during world war ii , schindler , an ethnic german from then-czechoslovakia and a member of the nazi party , persuaded german officers - through bribes and other means - to let him employ jews at his factory , saving them from the death camps . his story captured public attention decades later with steven spielberg 's 1993 oscar-winning movie schindler 's list , with liam neeson playing the lead role . after the war , schindler emigrated with his wife to argentina , but in 1958 returned to germany alone and died there in 1974 . she remained his legal heir . the suitcase containing schindler 's personal documents and pictures - as well as a number of copies of the original lists of jews he saved - eventually turned up in the home of a friend , the late annemarie staehr . in her lawsuit , rosenberg describes staehr as schindler 's ` lover ' and claims she took it from his home after he died . but yad vashem 's legal team says their relationship was platonic and that schindler had given her the suitcase and its contents as a gift . according to the plaintiff , the suitcase was found at staehr 's house after she died and her children handed it over to a german newspaper and the german national archives in 1997 . when news of the discovery became public , emilie schindler took legal action in germany to retrieve the suitcase and its contents . but when a judge turned up to search the premises of the newspaper in 1999 , he was told that they had already been sent to yad vashem , court documents show . in 2001 , emilie schindler returned to germany where she died , childless . in the last decade of her life , emilie schindler became close to rosenberg , her biographer , and designated her as heir to her estate . liam neeson as oskar schindler in spielberg 's oscar-winning movie . holocaust survivor solomon susskind - who was saved by oskar schindler 's list - places a flower at the hall of remembrance during a 2008 visit to the yad vashem holocaust museum in jerusalem . a woman looks at copies of facsimiles of oskar schindler 's lists displayed at the yad vashem holocaust memorial museum in jerusalem . yad vashem claims that rosenberg is a ` serial suer ' who is seeking to exploit schindler 's memory for her personal gain . documents related to schindler have financial as well as historic value . in 2013 , the blueprints for an expansion of his wartime factory in poland were sold for $ 63,426 and the same buyer paid $ 59,135 for a 1944 letter of introduction signed by schindler . none of the original lists of jews comprising the ` schindler lists ' remain , but historians believe seven copies were made of them shortly after world war ii . only one such copy is currently in private hands . every so often unsuccessful efforts are made to sell that document , most recently in 2013 with a starting price of $ 3 million . naor yair maman , who represents rosenberg , told afp in march his client had tried to retrieve the documents informally for years , before finally resorting to legal action against yad vashem . ` i 've no doubt that the issue of the ownership is very clear , ' he told afp . ` even if you believe that from the historical-academic perspective , it would be preferable that the documents remain in yad vashem , you have no right , whatsoever , to claim title to someone else 's property , ' he said . rosenberg does n't say in the suit what she wants to do with the documents . yad vashem is a national institution which is tasked with gathering , examining and researching materials pertaining to the holocaust . it is venerated within israel and a mandatory stop on the itinerary of visiting dignitaries . the museum says the disputed documents ` belong in the public domain ' . yad vashem insists it is legally entitled to the documents and has not acted in an underhand manner , denying claims by rosenberg 's legal team that it had ` grabbed ' the suitcase . ` yad vashem holds the documents lawfully and has acted the whole time openly and publicly , ' it said in a statement to afp , in which it expressed opposition to ` trading in holocaust-era documents ' . ` we will hold our debate with rosenberg in court to ensure these documents do not reach private hands , of those who are not their legal owners and whose interests are unclear , ' it said .

' the clintons ' family philanthropy came under fire in february for admitting it had accepted money directly from foreign governments including the united arab emirates , saudi arabia and oman . some of those donations came while mrs. clinton was the u.s. secretary of state . breitbart reported that the terms of rodham 's gold windfall upset members of haiti 's senate : the government 's royalties under the deal were pegged at just 2.5 per cent , half the customary rate . and vcs mining has an option to renew the terms for 25 years . harpercollins executive editor adam bellow , son of the famed novelist saul bellow , said in a statement that in schweizer 's book , he ` coins a new term to describe the unique way in which bill and hillary tend to mingle their political , personal and philanthropic interests . ' he calls it ` the clinton blur . ' ` schweizer 's exhaustively researched book raises serious questions about the sources of the clintons ' sudden wealth , their ethical judgment , and hillary 's fitness for high public office , ' bellow added . mrs. clinton was america 's first lady and a u.s. shuhenator before losing the democratic presidential nomination to barack obama in 2008 and joining his administration the following year . in addition to howls from the political right about her foundation 's role in attracting donors from among countries with whom she negotiated -- $ 500,000 of the clinton foundation 's haiti donations came from the algerian government , for example -- she is under fire for using a private email address run on her own server , during her years at the state department . she never had a ` state.gov ' address . instead she ran her professional and personal emails through her own internet domain , ` clintonemails.com , ' creating ethical and possibly legal issues because of the possibility that the state department has not archived all her messages . close : clinton greeted haitian president michel martelly warmly when she arrived for the indutrial ribbon cutting in 2012 . clinton got an additional black eye this week with the revelation that scott gration , who served as america 's ambassador to kenya for 13 months of her tenure , was ousted after he did somethign similar . when gration took over the nairobi embassy , according to a 2012 inspector general report , he insisted on the installation of a private , commercial internet connection in the bathroom attached to his office so he could communicate with the outside world beyond the reach of the state department . the federal records act requires employees of executive branch agencies to keep their emails and make them available for permanent retention . the law originally did not explicitly apply to electronic communications ; congress updated it after mrs. clinton left her job as america 's top diplomat . stories about government higher-ups using private email addresses for government work are nothing new . one obama administration official , former environmental protection agency administrator lisa jackson , used an email address with fictitious name attached -- ` richard windsor . ' but clinton is widely expected to announce a run for the white house next month , putting her conduct under an unforgiving microscope . members of congress typically have private email addresses , something that 's not prohibited under federal law for officials in the government 's legislative branch . federal law does , however , prohibit them from using their taxpayer-funded ` mail.house.gov ' or ` senate.gov ' addresses for fundraising and other political activity .

' there are also concerns about large quantities of meat being sold without any indication of how the animal was slaughtered and the petition says that until a ban is imposed , consumers must be told what they are buying . in a speech last year , prime minister david cameron vowed to uphold legal exemptions to animal slaughter rules for religious purposes such as muslim halal and jewish shechita . bva president mr blackwell said : ` this is a truly fantastic result for animal welfare . ` bva has long argued that all animals should be stunned before slaughter to render them insensible to pain and we are delighted that the british public has got so firmly behind our campaign . ` consumers value the high welfare of british produce and care deeply about the provenance of their food . ` but under the current legislation meat from non-stun slaughter can end up in the food chain unlabelled as such , which is completely unacceptable . ` scientific evidence tells us that non-stun slaughter allows the animal to perceive pain and compromises animal welfare . this is an issue that affects the welfare of millions of individual animals every year . ` the government simply can not ignore the strength of public feeling and we look forward to petitioning the backbench business committee for a full debate in the new parliament . ' the department for the environment , food and rural affairs -lrb- defra -rrb- remained unswayed by the petition hitting the 100,000 milestone - achieved by only 35 demands on the e-petition site since 2011 , around 0.1 % of those accepted . a spokeswoman said : ` there are strict rules that govern the slaughter of animals in england which include additional conditions for religious slaughter and these remain unchanged . ` the government has no intention of banning religious slaughter . ` the government would prefer animals to be stunned before slaughter , but we respect the rights of jewish and muslim communities to eat meat in accordance with their beliefs . ` existing rules require that where stunning is used it must be sufficient to make the animal unconscious and insensible to pain without causing unnecessary pain , suffering or distress .

' the drug is a formulation of deoxycholic acid , a ` naturally occurring molecule ' that helps our bodies break down the fat we receive from food , according to manufacturer kythera biopharmaceuticals . dr. michael edwards , president of the society for aesthetic plastic surgery , said not everyone is a good candidate for the drug . he told nbc news he worries that , after atx-101 is approved , people will use the drug to try and fix larger areas of fat . but according to weinkle , the drug is ` not a weight loss treatment ' and needs to be administered properly so that patients get a ` very even reduction of fat . ' she warns that physicians must ` understand the anatomy ' of the area underneath the chin , which houses delicate nerves that should not be touched . edward recommends patients only receive the procedure from trained ` board certified experts ' . atx-101 has been tested in 19 clinical studies with 2,600 patients . it will not be covered by insurance and the approximate cost is not yet known .

' itv selected contestants via auditions , and one who failed to get a place tweeted : ` my conclusion is that they are looking for people who purposely carry on for the camera because it will make great tv . ' barry , who is certified by the national guild of hypnotists , said : ` there is obviously a huge difference between using hypnosis as a therapy and as entertainment . ` all contestants were genuinely hypnotised . on many occasions they were throwing away their prize money -- something they would never ordinarily do , unless of course they were hypnotised .

' the row has arisen because jews believe they need to bury their loved ones within a day of their death so the period of mourning can begin . they also believe that traditional post-mortem examinations amount to desecration of the body . but when a doctor is unable to state a cause of death and sign the medical certificate needed before a body can be released for burial , a coroner must decide if a post-mortem examination is required . this process can take several days . following years of campaigning by muslims and jews -- who share many beliefs on burial customs -- the ministry of justice has agreed that all coroners in london will operate an out-of-hours service from next month . others in england and wales already do so .

' intelligence obtained via torture was reportedly used in a ` jack bauer real-time operation ' to foil an al-qaeda plot to bring down two planes and intercept a bomb at east midlands airport -lrb- pictured -rrb- . a major security alert was launched after plastic explosives concealed inside inkjet printer cartridges were discovered on two cargo planes travelling from yemen to the us in october 2010 . pictured is the package found at east midlands airport . a major security alert was launched after plastic explosives concealed inside inkjet printer cartridges were discovered on two cargo planes travelling from yemen to the us in october 2010 . it is believed the bombs were designed to go off mid-air and bring the huge planes down over the us . after what was described as a ` tip-off ' from saudi arabian security forces , the planes were stopped at east midlands airport in leicestershire and the united arab emirates and the bombs uncovered . a group called al-qaeda in the arabian peninsula -lrb- aqap -rrb- later took responsibility for the plot . now it has been claimed the discovery at east midlands airport was only possible because british officials in saudi arabia were in communication with a team believed to have been using torture on a member of terror group al-qaeda . ` the people in london went back on the phone two or three times to where the interrogation was taking place in riyadh to find out specifically where the bomb was hidden . there were two britons there , in immediate communication with where the interrogation was taking place , and as soon as it happened , they were in touch with the uk . it was all done in real time , ' an intelligence source told jamie merrill , james hanning , mark leftly and nick clark at the independent on sunday . a major security alert was launched after plastic explosives concealed inside inkjet printer cartridges were discovered on two cargo planes travelling from yemen to the us in october 2010 . pictured is a packaged being launched onto a police helicopter at east midlands airport . it is claimed the discovery at east midlands airport was only possible because british officials in saudi arabia were in communication with a team believed to have been using torture on a member of al-qaeda . a source close to the operation said there was ` no way ' that the information which led to the plot being exposed ` was n't procured under duress ' , but that the british officials would have ensured they were not present . he added : ` of course we use intelligence from torture . we take it from wherever we can get it , but we are never , ever going to say `` we do n't want that '' . or ask too many questions about where it has come from . it is the difference between intelligence and evidence . ' last month , following the death of king abdullah , prime minister david cameron defended britain 's ties with saudi arabia - despite the country 's record on human rights . he also said that a piece of counter-terrorism intelligence supplied by the arab state had ` saved potentially hundreds of lives ' in the uk , which aides have confirmed was a reference to the bomb plot . he added : ` now , you can be prime minister and say exactly what you think about every regime in the world and make great headlines , and give great speeches . former mi5 head sir john sawers said yesterday that torture does produce ` useful information ' and can be ` effective in the short term ' ` but i think my first job is to try and keep this country safe from terrorism and if that means you have to build strong relationships sometimes with regimes you do n't always agree with , that i think is part of the job and that is the way i do it . and that is the best way i can explain it . ' former spy chief sir john , who was head of mi6 from 2009 to 2014 , yesterday hit back at claims that security services played a role in the radicalisation of british jihadist mohammed emwazi . asim qureshi , research director of cage , claims emwazi , who was nicknamed jihadi john , was interrogated by mi5 and subjected to security agency harassment before becoming a militant . but sir john said arguments that harassment drove emwazi to join is were ` very specious ' . ` the idea that somehow being spoken to by a member of mi5 is a radicalising act , i think this is very false and very transparent , ' he told bbc radio 4 's today programme . sir john also told presenter mishal husain : ` torture had been used for `` thousands of years in order to extract useful information . ` if you decide in 2015 that it does n't work at all then that would be to misunderstand the problem . ' he added : ` the whole problem about torture and maltreatment is sadly is that it does produce intelligence . and that 's why in a civilised society like ours we have to set aside certain methods , even though they might be effective in the short term . in the longer term they are very counterproductive ; they are undermining the values of our society .

' i asked are there any people in the roma community in rotherham married to underage children - that 's under 16-years-old . ` we need a bit of honesty for the people of rotherham or we will go nowhere . ' cllr hoddinott replied : ` it 's a simple answer - yes , children are being married underage and that is unacceptable . ` we have to work with police to tackle that and we have to work with the commissioners to make sure there are actions in place to tackle these issues . rotherham council -lrb- pictured -rrb- heard there are underage illegal child brides in the town 's roma community . ` underage marriage is an issue in rotherham and we have to tackle that . part of that is understanding how we tackle it . ` we need to get it right - we ca n't write off those girls because they are in that community . ' but she said she was unable to say how many children in the town might be married to men already . but cllr parker said : ` you say you ca n't get the information , but a passport has marital status on it . if you 're concerned about a child then you can get that information from the police - saying you ca n't answer is unacceptable . ` if they 're here legally then they 're here on a passport and the police can find out . ' speaking after the meeting he said : ` officially in rotherham there are 6,500 roma gypsies but unofficially it is more like 7,500 . cllr martyn parker -lrb- pictured -rrb- said young roma girls are being married off and brought to rotherham . ' i believe there are young roma girls who come over here already married . they could n't possibly legally marry here . ` but when i have asked for information i have been told that it is not possible to find out but i believe council officials should be looking into this . ` we have already got the child sexual exploitation scandal in rotherham and i do n't want us in five or ten years time to have the same situation with this . ` just because a child is allowed to marry at the age of 12 or 13 in another country does n't mean we have to change our laws to accommodate that . we have one law which should be fairly implemented for everyone who lives here wherever they have come from . two damning reports into child sex abuse in rotherham revealed that more than 1,400 young girls were groomed , trafficked and abused by gangs of mostly pakistani men over a 16-year period . police and the town 's labour council were accused of covering up the abuse . the government has since appointed commissioners to take over running of the scandal-hit council . a south yorkshire police spokesman said : ` south yorkshire police is committed to tackling issues of underage and forced marriage . ` part of our strategy for tackling issues of forced marriage is that we consider the benefits of working in partnership locally and nationally . ` because forced marriage is often a hidden and under-reported crime , we recognise within south yorkshire that there is a need to develop creative and flexible ways to break down any barriers and to encourage full and active engagement with local agencies , communities and groups . ` information regarding forced marriage issues can be received from various sources and involve sensitive and complex issues . therefore within south yorkshire police we have specially trained officers who deal with such matters , such as domestic violence officers , and child protection officers . ` we would encourage any victim of forced marriage to come forward and report it to police , in the confidence that they will be listened to , that they will be taken seriously and that a thorough investigation will take place .

' miss guard , a fan of dogs and reality shows such as made in chelsea , lived with her parents and six siblings before she moved to windsor in berkshire , with her former teacher . the 18-year-old , who often posts light-hearted short videos of herself and friends on social media - openly states she is in a relationship with mr thomas on facebook . it is understood the couple moved to windsor because he has family living there . one former student wrote anonymously on social media : ` to everyone saying this is fine because he 's not her teacher anymore , i think this is disgusting . ` mr thomas taught me and during her lessons he would always be with her and just put on a film or something for us , he was a lovely teacher , friendly , etc and i feel sick knowing he taught me . ' another added : ` mr thomas was an excellent teacher who abused his position . to those who know him and the girl in question it is sickening . ' i feel for the students that he taught for letting them down so badly in their exam year . it is my understanding that quite a few pupils were aware of some sort of inappropriate friendship from year 11 . ` the whole story is sad . ' mr thomas was working at the school when he embarked on a relationship with the year 12 student , from downham , bromley , in 2013 . the report from the disciplinary hearing reveals the pair exchanged phone numbers , making 89 calls and texting 29 times over a one-month period during the summer holidays . and a former pupil , who also did not want to be named , said : ' i always saw them together whilst mr thomas was helping her with coursework or if she had a ` free lesson ' . ' ` after a while i noticed they were hanging around a lot more than a normal teacher would with a student but i did n't really take notice . ` as a teacher i thought mr thomas was a good teacher as he was willing to help you get the grades you wanted and the ones he expected from you . ` he was a generally funny person and someone you could trust . ' a spokesman for knights academy said : ` we are in full agreement with the teacher misconduct panel that mr jeff thomas ' behaviour was completely unacceptable and we fully support the banning order . ` the school took swift action as soon as it became aware that mr thomas had ignored all advice about his professional conduct . this resulted in his suspension and the referral of his case to the appropriate authorities , who have now taken the decision to ban him from teaching .

failing to protect vulnerable children from sexual abuse . one gang of asian men was responsible for abusing and enslaving 50 girls , mainly from oxford , but the men were also able to sexually torture girls as young as 11 for eight years after a series of missed opportunities to stop them . scroll down for video . abuse : more than 300 young people , mainly from oxford , pictured , were groomed , raped and sometimes forced into ` sex slavery ' by gangs over the last 15 years , a damning report will reveal tomorrow . tomorrow the county 's safeguarding children 's board will publish a review into 15 years of child exploitation , which will be ` brutal ' in its condemnation of the authorities . the victims , who were mainly girls under the age of 16 in the care system , were targeted by men from mainly asian gangs who raped , tortured and trafficked them for sex between 1999 and 2014 . some were abused for up to eight years despite asking for help from the authorities , who instead refused to believe them or blamed them . their abusers fed them drink and drugs before taking them to graveyards , a b&b and flats rented just for the rape and torture of children . according to the guardian , one 12-year-old girl was taken to a reading house for a backstreet abortion during a six-year period where she was passed between groups of men who raped her in what she called ` torture sex ' . the plight of the victims was laid bare in 2013 when seven members of a sadistic gang were jailed for a total of 95 years for their ` depraved ' and ` evil ' abuse of vulnerable girls . five gang members were given life sentences and two others were jailed for seven years for ` crimes of the utmost gravity ' . the paedophile network groomed more . than 50 vulnerable girls in oxford between 2004 and 2012 with gifts , . alcohol and drugs before subjecting them to extreme physical and sexual . violence . they used knives , meat cleavers and baseball bats to inflict severe pain on the girls for their twisted pleasure . but a catalogue of opportunities to stop the abuse was missed as early as may 2005 . jailed : brothers akhtar dogar -lrb- left -rrb- and anjum dogar -lrb- right -rrb- were each given a life sentence with a minimum of 17 years at the old bailey in 2013 for their role in the oxford abuse . abusers : mohammed karrar -lrb- left -rrb- ,

minimum of 15 years . attackers : kamar jamil -lrb- left -rrb- , 27 , was jailed for life with a minimum term of 12 years while assad hussain -lrb- right -rrb- , 32 , was sentenced to seven years in prison . on numerous occasions girls told . police officers , social workers and care staff in children 's homes how . they were raped or seriously sexually abused -- but no charges were . brought against the gang . three of the girls who gave evidence . at the trial were reported missing from residential care on 254 . occasions . paedophile : zeeshan ahmed , 28 , was jailed for seven years for two counts of sexual activity with a child . and the judge in the case , judge peter rook , said ` police and social services missed tell-tale signs ' about the abuse that was taking place . one social worker had earlier told the trial that ` nine out of ten ' people who were meant to be caring for the girls ` knew what was going on ' . life sentences were handed to akhtar dogar , 32 , and his brother anjum , 31 , who were both jailed for a minimum of 17 years , mohammed karrar , 38 , who will serve a minimum of 20 years , his brother bassam , 33 , jailed for a minimum of 15 years and kamar jamil , 27 , jailed for a minimum of 12 years . assad hussain , 32 , and zeeshan ahmed , 27 , were jailed for seven years . the latest serious case review came weeks after true scale of abuse in rotherham was revealed , where at least 1,400 girls fell into the clutches of paedophiles , mainly from pakistani backgrounds . whistleblowers who tried to raise concerns lost their jobs , and police officers often did not seem to believe the girls , their families or those who reported problems , and did not treat them as victims . one former police officer said : ` they were running scared of the race issue ... there is no doubt that in rotherham , this has been a problem with pakistani men for years and years . people were scared of being called racist . ' similar paedophile rings were uncovered in rochdale , greater manchester , and derby .

' it added : ` trevor is a talented comedian with a bright future at comedy central . ' noah , the son of a half-jewish xhosa mother and a swiss father , was a trending topic on twitter on monday night as he drew fire for jokes that were described as tasteless , hateful , and unfunny . the controversial tweets were posted between 2009 and 2014 . in may last year , noah tweeted : ` behind every successful rap billionaire is a double as rich jewish man . #beatsbydreidel . ' a year earlier , he posted : ` note to self - langostines are not jewish prawns . ' meanwhile , during a soccer match in january 2012 , he joked : ` messi gets the ball and the real players try foul him , but messi does n't go down easy , just like jewish chicks . #elclasico . ' he also slammed the united states ' midsection in a 2013 tweet , writing that ` when flying over the middle of america the turbulence is so bad . it 's like all the ignorance is rising through the air . ' and in 2009 , noah , who can speak an impressive six languages , wrote : ` almost bumped a jewish kid crossing the road . he did n't look b4 crossing but i still would hav felt so bad in my german car ! ' on tuesday , the tweets were being posted online by enraged bloggers , who slammed noah as ` racist ' . one said : ` jon stewart , born leibowitz , wo n't be happy about these highly antisemitic tweets . ' roseanne barr was among those calling out the comic , who has a global following and two million twitter followers , writing : ' u should cease sexist & anti semitic ` humor ' about jewish women & israel . ' meanwhile , a blogger posted noah 's tweets in an article , with the comment : ` trevor noah , the racist , hack taking over for jon stewart is also quite the anti-semite too . obama and progressive liberals really will love this guy . among some of the skits that trevor noah came up with was the black hitler . ' however , one twitter user , jack obora@jackobora, had a different opinion on the matter . he tweeted : ` seriously who reads through six years of tweets to try and find something to be offended about ? #trevornoah #dailyshow . ' viewers have lamented the end of jon stewart 's 16-year stint on the show . regardless of users ' opinions , the tweets showed a different side to noah than the picture painted by comedy central and the comedian himself just a day earlier . in a phone interview on monday from dubai , where he was traveling on a comedy tour , noah - who is no stranger to tackling controversial issues on-air - likened himself to new york-born stewart . he said : ` one thing we both share : we are both progressives , ' adding : ` traveling the world i 've learned that progressives , regardless of their locations , think in a global space . ' noah , who joined the daily show just three months ago and speaks an impressive six languages , was being pitched by comedy central as reflecting a new age of global multiculturalism . he is ' a citizen of the world , ' in the words of michele ganeless , the network 's president . his dry , cutting humor was also singled out by producers as the winning formula to win over viewers . successor : the 31-year-old south african comedian -lrb- pictured in 2012 -rrb- has been named successor to stewart , 52 , who will step down from his role on the show this year . appearance : in 2012 , noah became the first south african stand-up comedian to feature on nbc 's the tonight show -lrb- pictured -rrb- . in 2013 , he became the first to appear on cbs 's late show with david letterman . noah was named as the program 's new host a little more than a month after stewart unexpectedly announced he was leaving the daily show following 16 years as its principal voice . according to the new york times , a slew of better-known potential replacements chose to move on to competing networks . however , the reaction to his appointment was overwhelmingly positive . noah brings a wealth of hosting experience helping him , in ganeless ' words , check ` off every box ' on her network 's list of requirements . also important : he has kindred spirit stewart 's blessing . ` all i needed in my life was jon 's blessing . that 's what i have , so i 'm looking forward to being part of the best damn news show in the world , ' noah told the associated press . although no dates have been disclosed , stewart will likely depart by the end of the year . noah , who grew up in gauteng and starred on the south african soap opera , isiding , will take over soon after . tough act to follow : noah was not surprisingly reverent of extremely popular departing host jon stewart as he tweeted monday about the news he 's the next host . on monday , ganeless spoke of the advantage of introducing noah to a mainstream u.s. audience through the daily show , with viewers coming to the show he hosts with no preconceptions . ` they will get to discover him , and form their opinions of him , as they watch him host , ' he said . but by tuesday , some opinions were already forming . weighing in on noah 's selection , a slate column compared his vetting to that of sarah palin as a running mate for presidential candidate john mccain . the choice of a new host for the daily show is a critical decision not only for the satirical-news program , but for the network , whose identity has largely been forged by the daily show franchise , which for years was followed by the likewise signature the colbert report . by the end of this year , comedy central will have completely remade this programming block . in january , african-american comic larry wilmore replaced the the colbert report hosting the nightly show . born to a black mother and white father in south africa , 31-year-old noah was not allowed to live with either parent and even passed off by family as albino because , under apartheid laws , different races could not mix . trevor noah , 31 , grew up in soweto , south africa , the son of a xhosa mother and swiss father . ` my mother had to be very clandestine about who my father was , ' noah told the times . ` he could n't be on my birth certificate . ' for much of his childhood , his african family passed him off as an albino . under apartheid laws , different races could not mix and he was not allowed to live with either of his parents . he reportedly once cracked to an audience , ' i was born a crime . ' noah began doing stand-up in south africa in his twenties and has since leveraged his ability to speak six languages into an international career . he 's hosted his own late-night show in south africa , radio shows and awards shows . noah is also the only south african comedian to ever perform on the late show and tonight show . but do n't be too quick to connect him to the dark continent . he told letterman in 2013 : . ` they make it sound like a guy in leopard skin 's going to come running on the stage . ' nonetheless , noah 's past is firmly rooted in south africa 's turbulent racial history . ' i did n't live a normal life , ' he told the times . ' i grew up in a country that was n't normal . ' more specifically , noah says that after he began to do stand-up in his 20s , he quickly became aware that ` speaking freely about anything , as a person of color , was considered treason . ' news of his new role spread quickly in south africa . ` over the years , mr. noah has proved that laughter is the best medicine and has helped our country and its people to find healing through laughing at themselves , ' said minister of arts and culture nathi mthethwa . ` south africa is a microcosm of the world and there is no doubt that a global audience will find resonance in his humor , ' he added in an email .

' the test consists of three-minute segments that increase in speed and incline . follow the below stages in order to see which met score you reach . make sure you record your heart rate during each exercise . stage 1 - 1.7 mph/10 per cent grade/5 mets . stage 2 - 2.5 mph/12 per cent grade/7 mets . stage 3 - 3.4 mph/14 per cent grade/10 mets . stage 4 - 4.2 mph/16 per cent grade/13 mets . stage 5 - 5.0 mph/18 per cent grade/15 mets . stage 6 - 5.5 mph/20 per cent grade/18 mets . stage 7 - 5.5 mph/22 per cent grade/20 mets . then put in your details in to the following formula : . -lrb- 12 x mets -rrb- + -lrb- % of maximum predicted heart rate -rrb- -- -lrb- 4 x age -rrb- + 43 if female . maximum predicted heart rate is calculated as 220 -- age . heart rate achieved during exercise should be divided by maximum predicted . if you have at least zero , your survival rate is 97 percent in the next decade . in the study , scores ranged from negative 200 to positive 200 . if you score 100 or higher , you have have a two percent risk of dying over the next 10 years , while those with scores between 0 and 100 face a three per cent death risk over the next decade . if you have a score between negative 100 and 0 had an 11 per cent risk of dying in the next 10 years , while scores lower than negative 100 have a 38 per cent risk of dying in a decade . as well as age and gender , the formula factors in peak heart rate reached during intense exercise and the ability to tolerate physical exertion as measured by so-called metabolic equivalents , or mets . as well as age and gender , the formula factors in peak heart rate reached during intense exercise and the ability to tolerate physical exertion as measured by so-called metabolic equivalents , or mets . this is a gauge of how much energy the body expends during exercise . more vigorous activities require higher energy output -- or higher mets . an activity such as slow walking equals two mets , compared with eight for running . for the study , the team analysed information on 58,020 people , ages 18 to 96 , from detroit , michigan , who underwent standard exercise stress tests between 1991 and 2009 for evaluation of chest pain , shortness of breath , fainting or dizziness . the researchers then tracked how many of the participants within each fitness level died from any cause over the next decade . ` get busy living or get busy dying ' . these were the famous words of advice andy offered to red during his life sentence in shawshank redemption . they were the same words that were going round my head as i stepped up to the ` when am i going to die challenge ' . i 'm a 33-year-old man of average height and build with an emerging paunch . i spent my twenties drinking and smoking but thanks to a second go at hypnosis , i knocked the smokes on the head last year . i consider myself fairly healthy having passed my formative years swimming , cycling and playing football . now , when i can be bothered , i go to bikram yoga and run . the paunch bothers me . i looked at the test and thought : easy , before hauling myself off to the young man 's hebrew association on 14th . i fired up the treadmill and got going . stage 1 - 1.7 mph/10 per cent grade/5 mets . easy . i walk twice as fast . stage 2 - 2.5 mph/12 per cent grade/7 mets . still easy but it reminded me why hate treadmills . they make walking and running so boring . should have brought my headphones . stage 3 - 3.4 mph/14 per cent grade/10 mets . incline jump is considerate and i 'm starting to feel it . what is wrong with me ? the grim reaper is on my tail . stage 4 - 4.2 mph/16 per cent grade/13 mets . it was all that food and booze at christmas . i should have done dry january . must stop going to ray 's pizza . i 'm not going to finish this i know it . stage 5 5.0 mph/18 per cent grade/15 mets . no can do . treadmill does n't go up as far as 20 per cent and thank god . i 'm beat . i 'm done . no way i can do last two stages . pathetic . so there . 12 mins no more . it was the incline that got me . much harder than i thought . if the test is accurate i 've got two per cent chance of dying in the next ten years . i 'll take that . not as bad as i thought . unlike andy from shawshank redemption , i have n't got to start digging just yet . sean o'hare for dailymail.com . the results reveal that among people of the same age and gender , fitness level as measured by mets , and peak heart rate reached during exercise were the greatest indicators of death risk . fitness level was the single most powerful predictor of death and survival , even after researchers accounted for other important variables such as diabetes and family history of premature death . scores ranged from negative 200 to positive 200 , with those above 0 having lower mortality risk and those in the negative range facing highest risk of dying . patients who scored 100 or higher had a 2 per cent risk of dying over the next 10 years , while those with scores between 0 and 100 faced a 3 per cent death risk over the next decade . people with scores between negative 100 and 0 had an 11 percent risk of dying in the next 10 years , while those with scores lower than negative 100 had a 38 per cent risk of dying . ` the fit treadmill score is easy to calculate and costs nothing beyond the cost of the treadmill test itself , ' says senior study author michael blaha . the results reveal that among people of the same age and gender , fitness level as measured by mets , and peak heart rate reached during exercise were the greatest indicators of death risk . exercise stress tests usually measure how well the heart and lungs respond to physical exertion while a person is walking on a treadmill at progressively higher speed and elevation . the test is stopped once a person reaches the point of exhaustion or develops chest pain , dizziness or heart rhythm abnormalities . those who have normal readings and no alarming symptoms while exercising are said to have ` normal ' results and typically do not require further testing . however , the researchers say , the new data show varying degrees of fitness among those with ` normal ' stress test results that reveal telling clues about cardiac and respiratory fitness and , therefore , overall death risk over time . ` stress test results are currently interpreted as ` either/or ' but we know that heart disease is a spectrum disorder , ' dr ahmed says . ` we believe that our fit score reflects the complex nature of cardiovascular health and can offer important insights to both clinicians and patients .

' the lra - a violent rebel group led by kony - is renowned for being one of the most brutal forces in the world . ` worrying ' : ` the elephant population in the central african republic parks and garamba could be entirely decimated if the problem continues , ' said sasha lezhnev , associate director of policy at the enough project . park rangers are pictured here with elephant corpses . high tech : there is evidence of at least nine of the 131 elephants killed in garamba in the past 12 months being shot from helicopters . here , garamba national park staff examine the carcass of an elephant . they have become notorious for murder , mutilation , rape , widespread abductions of children and adults , and sexual slavery . the lra first emerged in northern uganda in 1986 , where it claimed to fight in the name of the acholi ethnic group against the government of ugandan president yoweri museveni . over the years , the lra has moved across the porous borders of the region : it shifted from uganda to sow terror in southern sudan before moving to northeastern democratic republic of congo , and finally crossing into southeastern central african republic in march 2008 . combining religious mysticism with an astute guerrilla mind and bloodthirsty ruthlessness , leader joseph kony has turned scores of young girls into his personal sex-slaves while claiming to be fighting to impose the bible 's ten commandments . as well as the rebel group , a recent report by the enough project revealed renegade elements of the congolese national army and armed poachers from sudan are responsible for the recent upsurge in poaching . in the past , poachers have used very basic methods to slaughter the elephants , killing just one or two at a time . now , heavily armed groups are using professional techniques and are bringing down three to eight of these majestic animals at a time . their tusks are then cut off with chainsaws . there is also evidence of at least nine of the 131 elephants killed in garamba in the past 12 months being shot from helicopters . in may last year , ten elephants were murdered in one day alone in garamba , according to african parks , a conservation group that manages the park with congolese authorities . at virunga national park , also in the dr congo , the elephant population has decreased by 90 per cent in the last twenty years , according to unesco . garamba in the north eastern corner of the democratic republic of congo is one of the oldest national parks in africa . spotted : a group of suspected lra fighters escort captives carrying supplies in garamba national park . high price : on the black market in asia , elephants tusks are valued at between # 13,300 and # 117,000 depending on their size . these tusks have been seized from poachers . the elephant tusks are helping fund murder , mutilation , rape , widespread abductions of children and adults , sexual slavery . park rangers display tusks recovered in the park . mr lezhnev stressed that rangers at the national park are working hard to prevent poaching , but they need more help . tracking poachers through the 3,000 sq-mile park is not only daunting , but dangerous , and rangers have been involved in deadly gun battles . ' a lot of the north region is not patrolled very well , ' mr lezhnev said . ` the rangers are active but are severely under capacitated . ` to solve this problem , first of all the park rangers need significantly increased assistance . they have reported a pretty dramatic rise in poaching over the last decade . ' killings : elephant numbers in the national park have fallen dramatically to about 2,400 from approximately 20,000 , largely due to poaching . the lra - a violent rebel group led by warlord kony -lrb- right -rrb- - is renowned for being one of the most brutal forces in the world . one of the reasons for the increase in elephant poaching is likely to be the rise in the price of ivory , which is at a record high because of demand in parts of asia , according to the enough project . on the black market , elephants tusks are valued at between # 13,300 and # 117,000 depending on their size . since the 1980s , the garamba elephant population has fallen to about 2,400 from approximately 20,000 , largely due to poaching . mr lezhnev added : ` if not enough action is taken , we could see the entire elephant population eliminated from these regions in the next 10 years .
